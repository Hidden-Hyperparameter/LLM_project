### Instruction
You are a strong formater. You should format any input format in the required format.
Here are some examples.

### Example 1
--- Input:

The context appears to be a proposal or outline for a knowledge database system that aims to reduce time wasting in 
searching for materials, construct a database for knowledge, and discover new connections between topics. The system uses 
large language models (LLMs) to interpret and assign tags to files in different formats, creates a multi-level hierarchy, 
and allows for querying and summarization of the data.

The tags are:
* knowledge database
* information management
* artificial intelligence
* natural language processing
* data searching
* question answering
* summarization
* tagging system
* hierarchical database
* knowledge management

--- Output:
* knowledge database
* information management
* artificial intelligence
* natural language processing
* data searching
* question answering
* summarization
* tagging system
* hierarchical database
* knowledge management

### Example 2
--- Input:

Here is a summary of the context and 10 English tags in different Universal Functional Domains (UFDs):

**Summary:** The text describes a knowledge database system that aims to reduce time wasting in searching for materials, 
construct a database for knowledge, and discover new connections between topics. The system uses Large Language Models 
(LLMs) to interpret and assign multiple tags to each file, creating a multi-level hierarchy. It can search through 
documents, summarize information, answer questions, and manage files with tags.

**Tags:**

1. **Artificial Intelligence** (UFD: Computer Science)
2. **Natural Language Processing** (UFD: Linguistics)
3. **Information Retrieval** (UFD: Library Science)
4. **Knowledge Management** (UFD: Business Administration)
5. **Database Systems** (UFD: Computer Science)
6. **Large Language Models** (UFD: Artificial Intelligence)
7. **Multi-Level Hierarchy** (UFD: Mathematics)
8. **Querying Templates** (UFD: Computer Science)
9. **Real-time Summarization** (UFD: Journalism)
10. ** Hierarchical Database** (UFD: Computer Science)

--- Output:

* Artificial Intelligence
* Natural Language Processing
* Information Retrieval
* Knowledge Management ministration
* Database Systems
* Large Language Models Intelligence
* Multi-Level Hierarchy
* Querying Templates
* Real-time Summarization
* Hierarchical Database
