Preface to the Third Edition 
The principal change from the second edition is the addition of Grébner bases to this 
edition. The basic theory is introduced in a new Section 9.6. Applications to solving 
systems of polynomial equations (elimination theory) appear at the end of this section, 
rounding it out as a self-contained foundation in the topic. Additional applications and 
examples are then woven into the treatment of affine algebraic sets and k-algebra homo- 
morphisms in Chapter 15. Although the theory in the latter chapter remains independent 
of Grébner bases, the new applications, examples and computational techniques sig- 
nificantly enhance the development, and we recommend that Section 9.6 be read either 
as a segue to or in parallel with Chapter 15. A wealth of exercises involving Groébner 
bases, both computational and theoretical in nature, have been added in Section 9.6 
and Chapter 15. Preliminary exercises on Grébner bases can (and should, as an aid to 
understanding the algorithms) be done by hand, but more extensive computations, and 
in particular most of the use of Grébner bases in the exercises in Chapter 15, will likely 
require computer assisted computation. 
Other changes include a streamlining of the classification of simple groups of order 
168 (Section 6.2), with the addition of a uniqueness proof via the projective plane of 
order 2. Some other proofs or portions of the text have been revised slightly. A number 
of new exercises have been added throughout the book, primarily at the ends of sections 
in order to preserve as much as possible the numbering schemes of earlier editions. 
In particular, exercises have been added on free modules over noncommutative rings 
(10.3), on Krull dimension (15.3), and on flat modules (10.5 and 17.1). 
As with previous editions, the text contains substantially more than can normally 
be covered in a one year course. A basic introductory (one year) course should probably 
include Part I up through Section 5.3, Part II through Section 9.5, Sections 10.1, 10.2, 
10.3, 11.1, 11.2 and Part IV. Chapter 12 should also be covered, either before or after 
Part IV. Additional topics from Chapters 5, 6, 9, 10 and 11 may be interspersed in such 
a course, or covered at the end as time permits. 
Sections 10.4 and 10.5 are at a slightly higher level of difficulty than the initial 
sections of Chapter 10, and can be deferred on a first reading for those following the text 
sequentially. The latter section on properties of exact sequences, although quite long, 
maintains coherence through a parallel treatment of three basic functors in respective 
subsections. 
Beyond the core material, the third edition provides significant flexibility for stu- 
dents and instructors wishing to pursue a number of important areas of modern algebra, 
xi
either in the form of independent study or courses. For example, well integrated one- 
semester courses for students with some prior algebra background might include the 
following: Section 9.6 and Chapters 15 and 16; or Chapters 10 and 17; or Chapters 5, 
6 and Part VI. Each of these would also provide a solid background for a follow-up 
course delving more deeply into one of many possible areas: algebraic number theory, 
algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, representation theory, Lie groups, etc. 
The choice of new material and the style for developing and integrating it into the 
text are in consonance with a basic theme in the book: the power and beauty that accrues 
from a rich interplay between different areas of mathematics. The emphasis throughout 
has been to motivate the introduction and development of important algebraic concepts 
using as many examples as possible. We have not attempted to be encyclopedic, but 
have tried to touch on many of the central] themes in elementary algebra in a manner 
suggesting the very natural development of these ideas. 
A number of important ideas and results appear in the exercises. This is not because 
they are not significant, rather because they did not fit easily into the flow of the text 
but were too important to leave out entirely. Sequences of exercises on one topic 
are prefaced with some remarks and are structured so that they may be read without 
actually doing the exercises. In some instances, new material is introduced first in 
the exercises—often a few sections before it appears in the text—so that students may 
obtain an easier introduction to it by doing these exercises (e.g., Lagrange’s Theorem 
appears in the exercises in Section 1.7 and in the text in Section 3.2). All the exercises 
are within the scope of the text and hints are given [in brackets] where we felt they were 
needed. Exercises we felt might be less straightforward are usually phrased so as to 
provide the answer to the exercise; as well many exercises have been broken down into 
a sequence of more routine exercises in order to make them more accessible. 
We have also purposely minimized the functorial language in the text in order to 
keep the presentation as elementary as possible. We have refrained from providing 
specific references for additional reading when there are many fine choices readily 
available. Also, while we have endeavored to include as many fundamental topics as 
possible, we apologize if for reasons of space or personal taste we have neglected any 
of the reader’s particular favorites. 
We are deeply grateful to and would like here to thank the many students and 
colleagues around the world who, over more than 15 years, have offered valuable 
comments, insights and encouragement—their continuing support and interest have 
motivated our writing of this third edition.

xii Preface
Preliminaries 
Some results and notation that are used throughout the text are collected in this chapter 
for convenience. Students may wish to review this chapter quickly at first and then read 
each section more carefully again as the concepts appear in the course of the text. 
0.1 BASICS 
The basics of set theory: sets, N, UL, €, etc. should be familiar to the reader. Our 
notation for subsets of a given set A will be 
B={aeéA]|... (conditions ona) ...}. 
The order or cardinality of a set A will be denoted by |A]. If A is a finite set the order 
of A is simply the number of elements of A. 
It is important to understand how to test whether a particular x € A liesina subset 
B of A (cf. Exercises 1-4). The Cartesian product of two sets A and B 1s the collection 
A x B = {(a, b) |a € A, b € B}, of ordered pairs of elements from A and B. 
We shall use the following notation for some common sets of numbers: 
(@) Z = {0, £1, +2, +3, ...} denotes the integers (the Z is for the German word for 
numbers: “Zahlen’’). 
(2) Q = {a/b | a, b € Z, b $ 0} denotes the rational numbers (or rationals). 
(3) IR = { all decimal expansions + d)d2...d,.a,a2a3...} denotes the real numbers 
(or reals). 
(4) C= {a+bi | a,b € R, it = —1} denotes the complex numbers. 
(5) Z*, Qt and R* will denote the positive (nonzero) elements in Z, Q and R, respec- 
tively. 
We shall use the notation f : A > BorA 4 B to denote a function f from A 
to B and the value of f at a is denoted f(a) (i.e., we shall apply all our functions on 
the left). We use the words function and map interchangeably. The set A is called the 
domain of f and B is called the codomain of f. The notation f : at bora br bif f 
is understood indicates that f(a) = b, i.e., the function is being specified on elements. 
If the function f is not specified on elements it is important in general to check 
that f is well defined, i.e., is unambiguously determined. For example, if the set A 
is the union of two subsets A; and A2 then one can try to specify a function from A 
1
to the set (0, 1} by declaring that f is to map everything in A, to O and is to map 
everything in Az to 1. This unambiguously defines f unless A) and A2 have elements 
in common (in which case it is not clear whether these elements should map to 0 or to 
1). Checking that this f is well defined therefore amounts to checking that A; and A2 
have no intersection. 
The set 
f(A) ={b € B|b= f(a), for somea € A} 
is a subset of B, called the range or image of f (or the image of A under f). For each 
subset C of 8 the set 
FTO =e Al f@eEC} 
consisting of the elements of A mapping into C under f is called the preimage or inverse 
image of C under f. For each b € B, the preimage of {b} under f is called the fiber of 
f over b. Note that f—! is not in general a function and that the fibers of f generally 
contain many elements since there may be many elements of A mapping to the element 
b. 
If f: A— Bandg: B — C, then the composite map go f : A > C is defined 
by 
(go f)(a) = g(f@)). 
Let f:A—> B. 
(1) f is injective or is an injection if whenever a; # a2, then f(a,) # f(a). 
(2) f is surjective or is a surjection if for all b € B there is some a € A such that 
f@ =b, Le., the image of f is all of B. Note that since a function always maps 
onto its range (by definition) it is necessary to specify the codomain B in order for 
the question of surjectivity to be meaningful. 
(3) f is bijective or is a bijection if it is both injective and surjective. If such a bijection 
f exists from A to B, we say A and B are in bijective correspondence. 
(4) f has a left inverse if there is afunction g : B — A such that go f : A > Ais 
the identity map on A, i.e., (g o f)(a) = a, for alla € A. 
(5) f has a right inverse if thereis a function h : B — A suchthat foh: B > Bis 
the identity map on B. 
Proposition 1. Let f : A —> B. 
(1) The map f is injective if and only if f has a left inverse. 
(2) The map f is surjective if and only if f has a right inverse. 
(3) The map f is a bijection if and only if there exists g : B — A such that f og 
is the identity map on B and g o f is the identity map on A. 
(4) If A and B are finite sets with the same number of elements (i.e., |A| = |B]), 
then f : A — B is bijective if and only if f is injective if and only if f is 
surjective. 
Proof: Exercise. 
In the situation of part (3) of the proposition above the map g is necessarily unique 
and we shall say g is the 2-sided inverse (or simply the inverse) of f. 
2 Preliminaries
A permutation of a set A is simply a bijection from A to itself. 
If A C Band f : B > C, we denote the restriction of f to A by f|,4. When the 
domain we are considering is understood we shall occasionally denote f|,4 again simply 
as f even though these are formally different functions (their domains are different). 
If AC Band g: A — C and there is a function f : B > C such that fl, = g, 
we shall say f is an extension of g to B (such a map f need not exist nor be unique). 
Let A be a nonempty set. 
(1) A binary relation on aset A is asubset Rof A x Aand wewritea ~ bif(a, b) € R. 
(2) The relation ~ on A is said to be: 
(a) reflexive if a ~ a, foralla € A, 
(b) symmetric if a ~ b implies b ~ a for alla,b € A, 
(c) transitive if a ~ b and b ~ cimpliesa ~ c for alla, b,c € A. 
A relation is an equivalence relation if it is reflexive, symmetric and transitive. 
(3) If ~ defines an equivalence relation on A, then the equivalence class of a € A is 
defined to be {x € A | x ~ a}. Elements of the equivalence class of a are said 
to be equivalent to a. If C is an equivalence class, any element of C is called a 
representative of the class C. 
(4) A partition of A is any collection {A; | i € J} of nonempty subsets of A (J some 
indexing set) such that 
(a) A= Ue Aj 5 and 
(b) A; A; = Q, foralli, j € J withi # j 
Le., A is the disjoint union of the sets in the partition. 
The notions of an equivalence relation on A and a partition of A are the same: 
Proposition 2. Let A be a nonempty set. 
(1) If ~ defines an equivalence relation on A then the set of equivalence classes of 
~ form a partition of A. 
(2) If {A; | ¢ € J} is a partition of A then there is an equivalence relation on A 
whose equivalence classes are precisely the sets A;, i € I. 
Proof: Omitted. 
Finally, we shall assume the reader is familiar with proofs by induction.

0.2 PROPERTIES OF THE INTEGERS 
The following properties of the integers Z (many familiar from elementary arithmetic) 
will be proved in a more general context in the ring theory of Chapter 8, but it will 
be necessary to use them in Part I (of course, none of the ring theory proofs of these 
properties will rely on the group theory). 
(1) (Well Ordering of Z) If A is any nonempty subset of Z*, there is some element 
m € A such that m < a, for all a € A (mis called a minimal element of A). 
(2) Ifa,b € Z witha $ O, we say a divides b if there is an element c € Z such that 
b = ac. In this case we write a | b; if a does not divide b we write a ¢ b. 
(3) Ifa, b € Z — {0}, there is a unique positive integer d, called the greatest common 
divisor of a and b (or g.c.d. of a and b), satisfying: 
(a) d | aandd | b(sod is acommon divisor of a and b), and 
(b) if e | a ande | b, then e | d (sod is the greatest such divisor). 
The g.c.d. of a and b will be denoted by (a, b). If (a, b) = 1, we say that a and b 
are relatively prime. 
(4) If a,b € Z — {0}, there is a unique positive integer /, called the least common 
multiple of a and b (or |.c.m. of a and b), satisfying: 
(a) a |/ and b| 1 (sol is acommon multiple of a and b), and 
(b) if a | m and b | m, then / | m (so / is the least such multiple). 
The connection between the greatest common divisor d and the least common 
multiple / of two integers a and b is given by dl = ab. 
(5) The Division Algorithm: if a,b € Z — {0}, then there exist unique g, r € Z such 
that 
a=qb+r and O<r< |b, 
4 Preliminaries
where q is the quotient and r the remainder. This 1s the usual “long division” 
familiar from elementary arithmetic. 
(6) The Euclidean Algorithm is an important procedure which produces a greatest 
common divisor of two integers a and b by iterating the Division Algorithm: if 
a, b € Z — {0}, then we obtain a sequence of quotients and remainders 
a=qob+ro (0) 
b=qrotn (1) 
ro = grit (2) 
ry = 93g +13 (3) 
Tn—-2 = Qn¥n-1 + n (n) 
Mn) = Qn+iln (n+1) 
where r,, is the last nonzero remainder. Such an r,, exists since |b| > |7o| > |ril > 
- > |r,| is a decreasing sequence of strictly positive integers if the remainders 
are nonzero and such a sequence cannot continue indefinitely. Then r,, is the g.c.d. 
(a, b) of a and b. 
Example 
Suppose a = 57970 and b = 10353. Then applying the Euclidean Algorithm we obtain: 
57970 = (5)10353 + 6205 
10353 = (1)6205 + 4148 
6205 = (1)4148 + 2057 
4148 = (2)2057 + 34 
2057 = (60)34 + 17 
34 = (2)17 
which shows that (57970, 10353) = 17. 
(7) One consequence of the Euclidean Algorithm which we shall use regularly is the 
following: if a, b € Z — {0}, then there exist x, y € Z such that 
(a, b) = ax + by 
that is, the g.c.d. of a and b is a Z-linear combination of a and b. This follows 
by recursively writing the element r,, in the Euclidean Algorithm in terms of the 
previous remainders (namely, use equation (1) above to solve for 7, = Tn-2—Gn¥n-1 
in terms of the remainders r,,_; and r,_2, then use equation (n — 1) to write r, in 
terms of the remainders r,,_2 and r,,_3, etc., eventually writing r,, in terms of a and 
b). 
Sec. 0.2 Properties of the Integers 5
Example 
Suppose a = 57970 andb = 10353, whose greatest common divisor we computed above to 
be 17. From the fifth equation (the next to last equation) in the Euclidean Algorithm applied 
to these two integers we solve for their greatest common divisor: 17 = 2057 — (60)34. 
The fourth equation then shows that 34 = 4148 — (2)2057, so substituting this expression 
for the previous remainder 34 gives the equation 17 = 2057 — (60)(4148 — (2)2057], 1.e., 
17 = (121)2057 — (60)4148. Solving the third equation for 2057 and substituting gives 
17 = (121)[(6205 — (1)4148] — (60)4148 = (121)6205 — (181)4148. Using the second 
equation to solve for 4148 and then the first equation to solve for 6205 we finally obtain 
17 = (302)57970 — (1691)10353 
as can easily be checked directly. Hence the equation ax + by = (a, b) for the greatest 
common divisor of a and b in this example has the solution x = 302 and y = —1691. Note 
that it is relatively unlikely that this relation would have been found simply by guessing. 
The integers x and y in (7) above are not unique. In the example with a = 57970 
and b = 10353 we determined one solution to be x = 302 and y = —1691, for 
instance, and it 1s relatively simple to check that x = —307 and y = 1719 also 
satisfy 57970x + 10353y = 17. The general solution for x and y is known (cf. the 
exercises below and in Chapter 8). 
(8) Anelement p of Z* is called a prime if p > 1 and the only positive divisors of p are 
1 and p (initially, the word prime will refer only to positive integers). An integer 
n > 1 which is not prime 1s called composite. For example, 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19.... 
are primes and 4,6,8,9,10,12,14,15,16,18,... are composite. 
An important property of primes (which in fact can be used to define the primes 
(cf. Exercise 3)) is the following: if p is a prime and p | ab, for some a, b € Z, 
then either p | a or p | b. 
(9) The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic says: if n € Z,n > 1, then n can 
be factored uniquely into the product of primes, 1.e., there are distinct primes 
Pi, P2,.--, Ps and positive integers a1, @2,...,@,; such that 
n= p;'p,’.-- DS. 
This factorization 1s unique in the sense thatif q,, q2, ..., G; are any distinct primes 
and £1, f2, ..-., B; positive integers such that 
n= 41'q3" Gi". 
then s = t andif we arrange the two sets of primes in increasing order, then q; = Pj 
and a; = f;, 1 <i < s. For example, n = 1852423848 = 233711719°31 and this 
decomposition into the product of primes 1s unique. 
Suppose the positive integers a and b are expressed as products of prime powers: 
a = p™ p®...p%, b= php... p® 
where P}, P2,.--, Ps are distinct and the exponents are > 0 (we allow the exponents 
to be O here so thatthe products are taken over the same set of primes — the exponent 
will be O if that prime is not actually a divisor). Then the greatest common divisor 
of a and bis . . . 
(a,b) = prinerBd pmintoa. Pr) _ pinines,Bs) 
6 Preliminaries
(and the least common multiple is obtained by instead taking the maximum of the 
a; and £; instead of the minimum). 
Example 
In the example above, a = 57970 and b = 10353 can be factored as a = 2-5-11-17-31 
and b = 3-7- 17-29, from which we can immediately conclude that their greatest common 
divisor is 17. Note, however, that for large integers it is extremely difficult to determine 
their prime factorizations (several common codes in current use are based on this difficulty, 
in fact), so that this 1s not an effective method to determine greatest common divisors in 
general. The Euclidean Algorithm will produce greatest common divisors quite rapidly 
without the need for the prime factorization of a and b. 
(10) The Euler y-function is defined as follows: for n € Zt let y(n) be the number of 
positive integers a < n witha relatively prime to n, 1.e., (a, n) = 1. For example, 
(12) = 4 since 1, 5, 7 and 11 are the only positive integers less than or equal 
to 12 which have no factors in common with 12. Similarly, g(71) = 1, g(2) = 1, 
(3) = 2, p(4) = 2, vS) = 4, ¢(6) = 2, etc. For primes p, y(p) = p — 1, and, 
more generally, for all a > 1 we have the formula 
y(p*) = p* — p*" = p*"(p— 1). 
The function ¢ is multiplicative in the sense that 
y(ab) = y(a)yg(b) if (a,b) = 1 
(note that it is important here that a and b be relatively prime). Together with the for- 
mula above this gives a general formula for the values of y : if n = p}' p>? ... p%, 
then 
y(n) = v(p;')v(p3”)-.. p(pe) 
= pt (pi — Wp? "(pa — 1)... pe" (ps — VD. 
For example, (12) = ¢(27)y(3) = 2!(2 — 1)39(3 — 1) = 4. The reader should 
note that we shall use the letter y for many different functions throughout the text 
so when we want this letter to denote Euler’s function we shall be careful to indicate 
this explicitly.

0.3 Z/n Z: THE INTEGERS MODULO n 
Let n be a fixed positive integer. Define a relation on Z by 
a ~ bif and only ifn | (b— a). 
Clearly a ~ a, anda ~ b implies b ~ a for any integers a and b, so this 
relation is trivially reflexive and symmetric. If a ~ b and b ~ c then n divides a — b 
and n divides b — c so n also divides the sum of these two integers, 1.e., n divides 
(a —b)+(b—c) =a-—c, soa ~ c and the relation is transitive. Hence this is an 
equivalence relation. Write a = b (mod n) (read: a is congruent to b mod n) ifa ~ b. 
For any k € Z we shall denote the equivalence class of a by a — this is called the 
congruence Class or residue class of a mod n and consists of the integers which differ 
from a by an integral multiple of n, Le., 
a={a+kn|k eZ} 
= {a,atn,at2n,a+3n,...}. 
There are precisely n distinct equivalence classes mod n, namely 
0,1,2,....n—1 
determined by the possible remainders after division by n and these residue classes 
partition the integers Z. The set of equivalence classes under this equivalence relation 
8 Preliminartes
will be denoted by Z/nZ and called the integers modulo n (or the integers mod n). 
The motivation for this notation will become clearer when we discuss quotient groups 
and quotient rings. Note that for different n’s the equivalence relation and equivalence 
classes are different so we shall always be careful to fix n first before using the bar 
notation. The process of finding the equivalence class mod n of some integer a 1s often 
referred to as reducing a mod n. This terminology also frequently refers to finding the 
smallest nonnegative integer congruent to a mod n (the least residue of a mod n). 
We can define an addition and a multiplication for the elements of Z/nZ, defining 
modular arithmetic as follows: for 4, b € Z/nZ, define their sum and product by 
G+b=a+b and 4a-b=ab. 
What this means is the following: given any two elements @ and b inZ/nZ, to compute 
their sum (respectively, their product) take any representative integer a in the class 
a and any representative integer b in the class b and add (respectively, multiply) the 
integers a and b as usual in Z and then take the equivalence class containing the result. 
The following Theorem 3 asserts that this is well defined, 1.e., does not depend on the 
choice of representatives taken for the elements a and b of Z/nZ. 
Example 
Suppose n = 12 and consider Z / 12Z, which consists of the twelve residue classes 
0,1,2,...,11 
determined by the twelve possible remainders of an integer after division by 12. The 
elements in the residue class 5, for example, are the integers which leave a remainder of 5 
when divided by 12 (the integers congruent to 5 mod 12). Any integer congruent to 5 mod 
12 (suchas 5, 17, 29, ... or —7, —19, ... ) will serve as a representative for the residue class 
5. Note that Z / 12Z consists of the twelve elements above (and each of these elements of 
Z / 12Z consists of an infinite number of usual integers). 
Suppose now thata = 5 and b = 8. The most obvious representative ford is the integer 
5 and similarly 8 is the most obvious representative for b. Using these representatives for 
the residue classes we obtain 5 + 8 = 13 = 1 since 13 and 1 lie in the same class modulo 
n = 12. Had we instead taken the representative 17, say, for a (note that 5 and 17 do lie in 
the same residue class modulo 12) and the representative —28, say, for b, we would obtain 
54+8=(17- 28) = —11 = 1 and as we mentioned the result does not depend on the 
choice of representatives chosen. The product of these two classes is 4-b = 5-8 = 40 = 4, 
also independent of the representatives chosen. 
Theorem 3. The operations of addition and multiplication on Z/nZ defined above 
are both well defined, that 1s, they do not depend on the choices of representatives for 
the classes involved. More precisely, if a;, a2 € Zand bi, b2 € Zwitha; = b, and 
@> = bo, then aq, + a) = b, + by and Gaz = bilby, ie., if 
aj=b, (modn) and a=bh2. (modn) 
then 
a, +a,=b,;+b2 (modn) and aja,g=bijb. (modn). 
Sec.03 Z / nZ : The Integers Modulon 9
Proof: Suppose a; = b; (mod n),i.e., a; — b; is divisible by n. Then a; = bi +sn 
for some integer s. Similarly, az = b2 (mod n) means a2 = b2 + tn for some integer t. 
Then a; +a2 = (b} +b2)+(s+t)n sothat a; +a2 = bi +b2 (mod n), which shows that 
the sum of the residue classes is independent of the representatives chosen. Similarly, 
ayaz = (bi) +sn)(bo+tn) = byb. + (bit +b2s+stn)n shows that a az = b,b2 (mod n) 
and so the product of the residue classes is also independent of the representatives 
chosen, completing the proof. 
We shall see later that the process of adding equivalence classes by adding their 
representatives 1s a special case of a more general construction (the construction of 
a quotient). This notion of adding equivalence classes is already a familiar one in 
the context of adding rational numbers: each rational number a/b is really a class of 
expressions: a/b = 2a/2b = —3a/ — 3b etc. and we often change representatives 
(for instance, take common denominators) in order to add two fractions (for example 
1/2 + 1/3 is computed by taking instead the equivalent representatives 3/6 for 1/2 
and 2/6 for 1/3 to obtain 1/2 + 1/3 = 3/6+ 2/6 = 5/6). The notion of modular 
arithmetic is also familiar: to find the hour of day after adding or subtracting some 
number of hours we reduce mod 12 and find the least residue. 
It is important to be able to think of the equivalence classes of some equivalence 
relation as elements which can be manipulated (as we do, for example, with fractions) 
rather than as sets. Consistent with this attitude, we shall frequently denote the elements 
of Z/nZ simply by {0, 1, ... , n — 1} where addition and multiplication are reduced mod 
n. Itis important to remember, however, that the elements of Z/nZ are not integers, but 
rather collections of usual integers, and the arithmetic is quite different. For example, 
5 + 8 is not | in the integers Z as it was in the example of Z / 12Z above. 
The fact that one can define arithmetic in Z / nZ has many important applications 
in elementary number theory. As one simple example we compute the last two digits in 
the number 2!©° | First observe that the last two digits give the remainder of 2!° after 
we divide by 100 so we are interested in the residue class mod 100 containing 2!0°, 
We compute 2!° = 1024 = 24 (mod 100), so then 27° = (2!°)? = 24? = 576 = 76 
(mod 100). Then 27° = (27°)? = 76? = 5776 = 76 (mod 100). Similarly 28° = 
2160 — 7320 = 20 = 76 (mod 100). Finally, 2! = 2692320240 — 76-76-76 = 76 
(mod 100) so the final two digits are 76. 
An important subset of Z/nZ consists of the collection of residue classes which 
have a multiplicative inverse in Z/nZ: 
(Z/nZ)* = {a € Z/nZ | there exists ¢ € Z/nZ with a -¢ = 1}. 
Some of the following exercises outline a proof that (Z/nZ)~ is also the collection 
of residue classes whose representatives are relatively prime to n, which proves the 
following proposition. 
Proposition 4. (Z/nZ)* = {a € Z/nZ | (a, n) = 1}. 
It is easy to see that if any representative of a 1s relatively prime to n then all 
representatives are relatively prime to n so that the set on the right in the proposition is 
well defined. 
10 Preliminaries
Example 
inverses of these elements are {1, 5, 7, 2, 4, 8}, respectively. 
If a is an integer relatively prime to n then the Euclidean Algorithm produces integers 
x and y satisfying ax +ny = 1, hence ax = 1 (mod n), so that x is the multiplicative 
inverse of a in Z/nZ. This gives an efficient method for computing multiplicative 
inverses in Z/nZ.

GROUP THEORY 
The modern treatment of abstract algebra begins with the disarmingly simple abstract 
definition of a group. This simple definition quickly leads to difficult questions involving 
the structure of such objects. There are many specific examples of groups and the power 
of the abstract point of view becomes apparent when results for all of these examples 
are obtained by proving a single result for the abstract group. 
The notion of a group did not simply spring into existence, however, but is rather the 
culmination of a long period of mathematical investigation, the first formal definition 
of an abstract group in the form in which we use it appearing in 1882.! The definition 
of an abstract group has its origins in extremely old problems in algebraic equations, 
number theory, and geometry, and arose because very similar techniques were found 
to be applicable in a variety of situations. As Otto Hélder (1859-1937) observed, one 
of the essential characteristics of mathematics 1s that after applying a certain algorithm 
or method of proof one then considers the scope and limits of the method. As a result, 
properties possessed by a number of interesting objects are frequently abstracted and 
the question raised: can one determine all the objects possessing these properties? 
Attempting to answer such a question also frequently adds considerable understanding 
of the original objects under consideration. It is in this fashion that the definition of an 
abstract group evolved into what is, for us, the starting point of abstract algebra. 
Weillustrate with a few of the disparate situations in which the ideas later formalized 
into the notion of an abstract group were used. 
(1) In number theory the very object of study, the set of integers, is an example of a 
group. Consider for example what we refer to as “Euler’s Theorem” (cf. Exercise 
22 of Section 3.2), one extremely simple example of which is that a*” has last two 
digits 01 if a is any integer not divisible by 2 nor by 5. This was proved in 1761 
by Leonhard Euler (1707-1783) using “group-theoretic” ideas of Joseph Louis 
Lagrange (1736-1813), long before the first formal definition of a group. From 
our perspective, one now proves “Lagrange’s Theorem” (cf. Theorem 8 of Section 
3.2), applying these techniques abstracted to an arbitrary group,and then recovers 
Euler’s Theorem (and many others) as a special case.

(2) Investigations into the question of rational solutions to algebraic equations of the 
form y* = x? — 2x (there are infinitely many, for example (0, 0), (—1, 1), (2, 2), 
(9/4, —21/8), (—1/169, 239/2197)) showed that connecting any two solutions by 
a straight line and computing the intersection of this line with the curve y? = 
x* — 2x produces another solution. Such “Diophantine equations,” among others, 
were considered by Pierre de Fermat (1601—1655) (this one was solved by him in 
1644), by Euler, by Lagrange around 1777, and others. In 1730 Euler raised the 
question of determining the indefinite integral {dx /./1 — x* of the “lemniscatic 
differential” dx //1 — x+, used in determining the arc length along an ellipse (the 
question had also been considered by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716) and 
Johannes Bernoulli (1667—1748)). In 1752 Euler proved a “multiplication formula” 
for such elliptic integrals (using ideas of G.C. di Fagnano (1682-1766), received 
by Euler in 1751), which shows how two elliptic integrals give rise to a third, 
bringing into existence the theory of elliptic functions in analysis. In 1834 Carl 
Gustav Jacob Jacobi (1804—1851) observed that the work of Euler on solving certain 
Diophantine equations amounted to writing the multiplication formula for certain 
elliptic integrals. Today the curve above is referred to as an “elliptic curve” and 
these questions are viewed as two different aspects of the same thing — the fact 
that this geometric operation on points can be used to give the set of points on an 
elliptic curve the structure of a group. The study of the “arithmetic” of these groups 
is an active area of current research.” 
(3) By 1824 it was known that there are formulas giving the roots of quadratic, cubic 
and quartic equations (extending the familiar quadratic formula for the roots of 
ax? + bx +c = 0). In 1824, however, Niels Henrik Abel (1802-1829) proved 
that such a formula for the roots of a quintic is impossible (cf. Corollary 40 of 
Section 14.7). The proof is based on the idea of examining what happens when 
the roots are permuted amongst themselves (for example, interchanging two of the 
roots). The collection of such permutations has the structure of a group (called, 
naturally enough, a “permutation group”). This idea culminated in the beautiful 
work of Evariste Galois (1811—1832) in 1830-32, working with explicit groups 
of “substitutions.” Today this work is referred to as Galois Theory (and is the 
subject of the fourth part of this text). Similar explicit groups were being used 
in geometry as collections of geometric transformations (translations, reflections, 
etc.) by Arthur Cayley (1821-1895) around 1850, Camille Jordan (1838-1922) 
around 1867, Felix Klein (1849-1925) around 1870, etc., and the application of 
groups to geometry 1s still extremely active 1n current research into the structure of 
3-space, 4-space, etc. The same group arising in the study of the solvability of the 
quintic arises in the study of the rigid motions of an icosahedron in geometry and 
in the study of elliptic functions in analysis. 
The precursors of today’s abstract group can be traced back many years, even 
before the groups of “substitutions” of Galois. The formal definition of an abstract 
group which 1s our starting point appeared 1n 1882 1n the work of Walter Dyck (1856- 
1934), an assistant to Felix Klein, and also 1n the work of Heinnch Weber (1842-1913)

in the same year. 
It is frequently the case in mathematics research to find specific application of 
an idea before having that idea extracted and presented as an item of interest in its 
own right (for example, Galois used the notion of a “quotient group” implicitly in his 
investigations in 1830 and the definition of an abstract quotient group is due to Hélder in 
1889). Itis important to realize, with or without the historical context, that the reason the 
abstract definitions are made is because it is useful to isolate specific characteristics and 
consider what structure is imposed on an object having these characteristics. The notion 
of the structure of an algebraic object (which is made more precise by the concept of 
an isomorphism — which considers when two apparently different objects are in some 
sense the same) is a major theme which will recur throughout the text.

CHAPTER 1 
Introduction to Groups 
1.1 BASIC AXIOMS AND EXAMPLES 
In this section the basic algebraic structure to be studied in Part Iis introduced and some 
examples are given. 
Definition. 
(1) A binary operation x on aset G is afunction * : G x G — G. Foranya,bé€G 
we Shall write a « b for «(a, b). 
(2) A binary operation * on a set G 1s associative if for all a, b,c € G we have 
ax(bxc) = (axb) xc. 
(3) If * is a binary operation on a set G we say elements a and b of G commute if 
axb =bxa. We say « (or G) 1s commutative if for alla, b € G,axb=bxa. 
Examples 
(1) + (usual addition) is a commutative binary operation on Z (or on Q, R, or C respec- 
tively). 
(2) x (usual multiplication) is a commutative binary operation on Z (or on Q, R, or C 
respectively). 
(3) — (usual subtraction) is a noncommutative binary operation on Z, where —(a, b) = 
a — b. The mapa +> —a 1s not a binary operation (not binary). 
(4) — is not a binary operation on Z+ (nor Qt, R*) because for a, b € Zt witha < b, 
a—b¢Z", that is, — does not map Zt x Z*+ into Z*. 
(5) Taking the vector cross-product of two vectors in 3-space R? is a binary operation 
which is not associative and not commutative. 
Suppose that « is a binary operation on a set G and H is a subset of G. If the 
restriction of x to H is a binary operation on H, 1., for alla,b € H,axbe H, 
then #7 is said to be closed under x. Observe that if * is an associative (respectively, 
commutative) binary operation on G and « restricted to some subset H of G is a binary 
operation on H, then * is automatically associative (respectively, commutative) on H 
as well. 
Definition. 
(1) A group is an ordered pair (G, *) where G is a set and * is a binary operation 
on G satisfying the following axioms: 
16
(i) (axb)xc=ax(bxc), for all a, b,c € G, 1.e., * 1S associative, 
(ii) there exists an element e 1n G, called an identity of G, such that for all 
aeéGwehavearte=exa=a, 
(iii) for each a € G there is an element a™! of G, called an inverse of a, 
such thataxa~! =a"! x*a=e. 
(2) The group (G, *) 1s called abelian (or commutative ) if a*b = b «a for all 
a,beG. 
We shall immediately become less formal and say G 1s a group under « if (G, *) 1s 
a group (or just G is a group when the operation * 1s clear from the context). Also, we 
say G is a finite group if in addition G is a finite set. Note that axiom (ii) ensures that 
a group is always nonempty. 
Examples 
(1) Z, Q, R and C are groups under + with e = O and a~! = —a, forall a. 
(2) Q — {0}, R — {0}, C — {0}, Qt, R®* are groups under x with e = 1 anda7! = 1 
for all a. Note however that Z — {0} is not a group under x because although x is an 
associative binary operation on Z — {0}, the element 2 (for instance) does not have an 
inverse 1n Z — {O}. 
We have glossed over the fact that the associative law holds in these familiar ex- 
amples. For Z under + this is a consequence of the axiom of associativity for addition 
of natural numbers. The associative law for Q under + follows from the associative 
law for Z — a proof of this will be outlined later when we rigorously construct Q from 
Z (cf. Section 7.5). The associative laws for R and, in turn, C under + are proved 
in elementary analysis courses when R is constructed by completing Q — ultimately, 
associativity 1s again a consequence of associativity for Z. The associative axiom for 
multiplication may be established via a similar development, starting first with Z. Since 
R and C will be used largely for illustrative purposes and we shall not construct R from 
Q (although we shall construct C from R) we shall take the associative laws (under + 
and x ) for R and C as given. 
Examples (continued) 
(3) The axioms for a vector space V include those axioms which specify that (V, +) is an 
abelian group (the operation + is called vector addition). Thus any vector space such 
as IR” 1s, 1n particular, an additive group. 
(4) Forn € Zt, Z/nZ is an abelian group under the operation + of addition of residue 
classes as described in Chapter 0. We shall prove in Chapter 3 (in a more general 
context) that this binary operation + 1s well defined and associative; for now we take 
this for granted. The identity in this group is the element 0 and for each @ € Z/nZ, 
the inverse of a is —a. Henceforth, when we talk about the group Z/nZ it will be 
understood that the group operation is addition of classes mod n. 
(5) For n € Zt, the set (Z/nZ)* of equivalence classes a which have multiplicative 
inverses mod n Is an abelian group under multiplication of residue Classes as described 
in Chapter 0. Again, we shall take for granted (for the moment) that this operation 
is well defined and associative. The identity of this group is the element 1 and, by 
Sec. 1.1. Basic Axioms and Examples 17
definition of (Z/nZ)*, each element has a multiplicative inverse. Henceforth, when 
we talk about the group (Z/nZ)” it will be understood that the group operation is 
multiplication of classes mod n. 
(6) If (A, *) and (B, ©) are groups, we can form anew group A x B, called their direct 
product, whose elements are those in the Cartesian product 
Ax B={(a,b)|aeA, be B} 
and whose operation is defined componentwise: 
(a1, b1) (a2, b2) = (a1 * a2, by © 52). 
For example, if we take A = B = R (both operations addition), R x R is the familiar 
Euclidean plane. The proof that the direct product of two groups is again a group is 
left as a straightforward exercise (later) — the proof that each group axiom holds in 
A x B is aconsequence of that axiom holding in both A and B together with the fact 
that the operation in A x B 1s defined componentwise. 
There should be no confusion between the groups Z/nZ (under addition) and 
(Z/nZ)* (under multiplication), even though the latter 1s a subset of the former — the 
superscript x will always indicate that the operation 1s multiplication. 
Before continuing with more elaborate examples we prove two basic results which 
in particular enable us to talk about the identity and the inverse of an element. 
Proposition 1. If G is a group under the operation » , then 
(1) the identity of G 1s unique 
(2) for each a € G, a! is uniquely determined 
(3) (a~'!)“! =a forallaeG 
(4) (axb)! = (6) «(a") 
(5) for any aj, a2,...,@, € G the value of a) * a) *-- - *a,, 1s independent of how 
the expression is bracketed (this is called the generalized associative law). 
Proof: (1) If f and g are both identities, then by axiom (ii) of the definition of a 
group f *«g = f (take a = f ande = g). By the same axiom f « g = g (take a = g 
and e = f). Thus f = g, and the identity is unique. 
(2) Assume b and c are both inverses of a and let e be the identity of G. By axiom 
(ill), ax b =e andcxa=e. Thus 
c=Cre (definition of e - axiom (i1)) 
=cx(axb) (since e = axb) 
= (cxa)«xb (associative law) 
—exb (sincee = cx«a) 
=b (axiom (ii)). 
(3) To show (a~!)~! = a is exactly the problem of showing a is the inverse of a7! 
(since by part (2) a has a unique inverse). Reading the definition of a~!, with the roles 
of a and a~! mentally interchanged shows that a satisfies the defining property for the 
inverse of a~!, hence a is the inverse of a~!. 
18 Chap.1 Introduction to Groups
(4) Let c = (a x b)~! so by definition of c, (a * b) xc = e. By the associative law 
ax(bxc)=e. 
Multiply both sides on the left by a! to get 
a x(ax(b«c)) =a! xe. 
The associative law on the left hand side and the definition of e on the right give 
(a! xa)«(bxc) =a"! 
SO 
ex(bxc)=a! 
hence 
becz=a. 
Now multiply both sides on the left by b~' and simplify similarly: 
b' «(bec =b' «a7 
(b' «b)xc=b' xa! 
exc=b'xa" 
c=b' xa", 
as claimed. 
(5) This is left as a good exercise using induction on n. First show the result is true 
forn = 1,2, and 3. Next assume for any k < n that any bracketing of a product of k 
elements, b, * bz x -- - « b, can be reduced (without altering the value of the product) to 
an expression of the form 
b, * (bo & (b3 & (- ++ & By))...). 
Now argue that any bracketing of the product a, * a2 * --- * a, must break into 2 
subproducts, say (a * G2 *--- * Ay) & (A411 * Ap42 * +++ * a,), Where each sub-product 
is bracketed in some fashion. Apply the induction assumption to each of these two 
sub-products and finally reduce the result to the form a, * (@2 * (a3 *(--- *@,))...) to 
complete the induction. 
Note that throughout the proof of Proposition 1 we were careful not to change 
the order of any products (unless permitted by axioms (ii) and (i11)) since G may be 
non-abelian. 
Notation: 
(1) For an abstract group G it is tiresome to keep writing the operation « throughout 
our calculations. Henceforth (except when necessary) our abstract groups G, H, 
etc. will always be written with the operation as - and a - b will always be written 
as ab. In view of the generalized associative law, products of three or more group 
elements will not be bracketed (although the operation 1s still a binary operation). 
Finally, for an abstract group G (operation -) we denote the identity of G by 1. 
Sec. 1.1. Basic Axioms and Examples 19
(2) For any group G (operation - implied) and x € G and n € Z* since the product 
xx -+-x (n terms) does not depend on how it is bracketed, we shall denote it by x”. 
Denote x~!x—! - -- x7! (n terms) by x—”. Let x° = 1, the identity of G. 
This new notation 1s pleasantly concise. Of course, when we are dealing with 
specific groups, we shall use the natural (given) operation. For example, when the 
operation 1s +, the identity will be denoted by O and for any element a, the inverse a7! 
will be written —a anda+a+-:--+a(n > Oterms) will be written na; —a—a---—a 
(n terms) will be written —na and Oa — 0. 
Proposition 2. Let G be a group and let a, b € G. The equations ax = b and ya = b 
have unique solutions for x, y € G. In particular, the left and right cancellation laws 
hold in G, 1.e., 
(1) if au = av, then u = v, and 
(2) if ub = vb, then u = v. 
Proof: We can solve ax = b by multiplying both sides on the left by a~! and 
simplifying to get x = a~'b. The uniqueness of x follows because a! is unique. 
Similarly, if ya = b, y = ba~'. If au = av, multiply both sides on the left by a~! and 
simplify to get u = v. Similarly, the mght cancellation law holds. 
One consequence of Proposition 2 1s that if a 1s any element of G and for some 
b € G, ab = eorba = e, then b = a“, ie., we do not have to show both equations 
hold. Also, if for some b € G, ab = a (or ba = a), then b must be the identity of G, 
1.e., we do not have to check bx = xb = x for all x € G. 
Definition. For G a group and x € G define the order of x to be the smallest positive 
integer n such that x” = 1, and denote this integer by |x]. In this case x is said to be of 
order n. If no positive power of x is the identity, the order of x is defined to be infinity 
and x is said to be of infinite order. 
The symbol for the order of x should not be confused with the absolute value symbol 
(when G C R we shall be careful to distinguish the two). It may seem injudicious to 
choose the same symbol for order of an element as the one used to denote the cardinality 
(or order) of a set, however, we shall see that the order of an element in a group 1s the 
same as the cardinality of the set of all its (distinct) powers so the two uses of the word 
“order” are naturally related. 
Examples 
(1) Anelement of a group has order 1 if and only if it is the identity. 
(2) In the additive groups Z, Q, R or C every nonzero (i.e., nonidentity) element has 
infinite order. 
(3) In the multiplicative groups IR — {0} or Q — {0} the element —1 has order 2 and all 
other nonidentity elements have infinite order. 
(4) In the additive group Z/9Z the element 6 has order 3, since 6 # 0,6+6 = 12 =3 £0, 
but 6+ 6+ 6 = 18 = 0, the identity in this group. Recall that in an additive group the 
powers of an element are the integer multiples of the element. Similarly, the order of 
the element 5 is 9, since 45 is the smallest positive multiple of 5 that is divisible by 9. 
20 Chap.1 Introduction to Groups
(5) In the multiplicative group (Z/7Z)”, the powers of the element 2 are 2,4, 8 = 1, the 
identity in this group, so 2 has order 3. Similarly, the element 3 has order 6, since 3° 
is the smallest positive power of 3 that is congruent to 1 modulo 7. 
Definition. Let G = {21, g2,.--, 2,} bea finite group with g; = 1. The multiplica- 
tion table or group table of G is the n x n matrix whose i, j entry is the group element 
&i 8j- 
Fora finite group the multiplication table contains, in some sense, all the information 
about the group. Computationally, however, it is an unwieldly object (being of size the 
square of the group order) and visually it is not a very useful object for determining 
properties of the group. One might think of a group table as the analogue of having a 
table of all the distances between pairs of cities in the country. Such a table is useful 
and, in essence, captures all the distance relationships, yet a map (better yet, a map with 
all the distances labelled on it) is a much easier tool to work with. Part of our initial 
development of the theory of groups (finite groups in particular) is directed towards a 
more conceptual way of visualizing the internal structure of groups.

Assume G = {1, a, b, c} is a group of order 4 with identity 1. Assume also that G has no

laws to show that there is a unique group table for G. Deduce that G is abelian. 
1.2 DIHEDRAL GROUPS 
An important family of examples of groups is the class of groups whose elements are 
symmetries of geometric objects. The simplest subclass is when the geometric objects 
are regular planar figures. 
For eachn € Zt, n > 3 let D>, be the set of symmetries of a regular n-gon, where 
a symmetry is any rigid motion of the n-gon which can be effected by taking a copy 
of the n-gon, moving this copy in any fashion in 3-space and then placing the copy 
back on the original n-gon so it exactly covers it. More precisely, we can describe the 
symmetries by first choosing a labelling of the n vertices, for example as shown in the 
following figure. 
Sec. 1.2. Dihedral Groups 23
Then each symmetry s can be described uniquely by the corresponding permutation o 
of {1, 2, 3,...,n} where if the symmetry s puts vertex 7 in the place where vertex j 
was originally, then o is the permutation sending i to j. For instance, if s is a rotation 
of 27 /n radians clockwise about the center of the n-gon, then o 1s the permutation 
sending i toi + 1,1 <i < n-—1, ando(n) = 1. Now make D>», into a group by 
defining st for s,t € D2, to be the symmetry obtained by first applying t then s to 
the n-gon (note that we are viewing symmetries as functions on the n-gon, so st is just 
function composition — read as usual from right to left). If s, t effect the permutations 
oO, t, respectively on the vertices, then st effects o o t. The binary operation on D2, 
IS associative since composition of functions is associative. The identity of D2, 1s the 
identity symmetry (which leaves all vertices fixed), denoted by 1, and the inverse of 
s € D2, isthe symmetry which reverses all rigid motions of s (so if s effects permutation 
o on the vertices, s~! effects o~'). In the next paragraph we show 
[Dal = 2n 
and so D2, is called the dihedral group of order 2n. In some texts this group is written 
D,,; however, D2, (where the subscript gives the order of the group rather than the 
number of vertices) is more common in the group theory literature. 
To find the order | D2,| observe that given any vertex i, there 1s a symmetry which 
sends vertex 1 into position i. Since vertex 2 1s adjacent to vertex 1, vertex 2 must 
end up in position 7 + 1 ori — 1 (where n + | 1s 1 and 1 — 1 1s n, Le., the integers 
labelling the vertices are read mod n ). Moreover, by following the first symmetry by a 
reflection about the line through vertexi and the center of the n-gon one sees that vertex 
2 can be sent to either position i + 1 or i — 1 by some symmetry. Thus there are n - 2 
positions the ordered pair of vertices 1, 2 may be sent to upon applying symmetries. 
Since symmetries are rigid motions one sees that once the position of the ordered pair 
of vertices 1, 2 has been specified, the action of the symmetry on all remaining vertices 
is completely determined. Thus there are exactly 2n symmetries of a regular n-gon. We 
can, moreover, explicitly exhibit 21 symmetries. These symmetries are the n rotations 
about the center through 277i /n radian, 0 < i < n—1, and then reflections through the 
n lines of symmetry (if n is odd, each symmetry line passes through a vertex and the 
mid-point of the opposite side; 1f n 1s even, there are n/2 lines of symmetry which pass 
through 2 opposite vertices and n/2 which perpendicularly bisect two opposite sides). 
For example, if n = 4 and we draw a square at the origin in an x, y plane, the lines of 
symmetry are

24 Chap.1 Introduction to Groups
the lines x = O (y-axis), y = O (x-axis), y = x and y = —x (note that “reflection” 
through the origin is not a reflection but a rotation of 7 radians). 
Since dihedral groups will be used extensively as an example throughout the text 
we fix some notation and mention some calculations which will simplify future com- 
putations and assist in viewing D2, as an abstract group (rather than having to return to 
the geometric setting at every instance). Fix a regular 7-gon centered at the origin in an 
x, y plane and label the vertices consecutively from | to n ina clockwise manner. Let r 
be the rotation clockwise about the origin through 277/n radian. Let s be the reflection 
about the line of symmetry through vertex 1 and the origin (we use the same letters for 
each n, but the context will always make n clear). We leave the details of the following 
calculations as an exercise (for the most part we shall be working with Dg and Dg, so 
the reader may wish to try these exercises for n = 3 andn = 4 first): 
(1) 1,r,r?,...,r”7! are all distinct and r” = 1, so |r| =n. 
(2) |s| = 2. 
(3) s #r’ for any i. 
(4) sr' £sr/, for all0 <i, j <n—1 withi S$ j,so 
Do, ={l,r,r’,...,r”',5, sr, sr’,..., sr" } 
i.e., each element can be written uniquely in the form s*r‘ for some k = 0 or 
landO <i <n-1. 
(5) rs = sr~'. [First work out what permutation s effects on {1,2,...,n} and 
then work out separately what each side in this equation does to vertices 1 
and 2.) This shows in particular that r and s do not commute so that D2, 1s 
non-abelian. 
(6) r's = sr—', for allO <i <n. [Proceed by induction on and use the fact that 
rit!s = r(r‘s) together with the preceding calculation.] This indicates how to 
commute s with powers of r. 
Having done these calculations, we now observe that the complete multiplication 
table of D>, can be written in terms r and s alone, that is, all the elements of D2, have a 
(unique) representation in the form s*r', k = Oor 1 andO < i < n—1, and any product 
of two elements in this form can be reduced to another in the same form using only 
“relations” (1), (2) and (6) (reducing all exponents mod n). For example, if n = 12, 
(sr?)(sr°) = s(r?s)r® = s(sr~*)r® = s*r?** = pF =r’, 
Generators and Relations 
The use of the generators r and s for the dihedral group provides a simple and succinct 
way of computing in D2,. We can similarly introduce the notions of generators and 
relations for arbitrary groups. It is useful to have these concepts early (before their 
formal justification) since they provide simple ways of describing and computing in 
many groups. Generators will be discussed in greater detail in Section 2.4, and both 
concepts will be treated rigorously in Section 6.3 when we introduce the notion of free 
groups. 
Sec. 1.2 Dihedral Groups 25
A subset S of elements of a group G with the property that every element of G 
can be written as a (finite) product of elements of S and their inverses is called a set of 
generators of G. We shall indicate this notationally by writing G = (S$) and say G 
is generated by S or S generates G. For example, the integer 1 is a generator for the 
additive group Z of integers since every integer is a sum of a finite number of +1’s and 
—1’s, so Z = (1). By property (4) of D2, the set § = {r,s} is a set of generators of 
D2,, SO D2, = (7, 5). We shall see later that in a finite group G the set S generates 
G if every element of G is a finite product of elements of S (1.e., it is not necessary to 
include the inverses of the elements of S as well). 
Any equations in a general group G that the generators satisfy are called relations 
in G. Thus in D,,, we have relations: r” = 1, s? = 1 and rs = sr~!. Moreover, in 
D>, these three relations have the additional property that any other relation between 
elements of the group may be derived from these three (this is not immediately obvious; 
‘it follows from the fact that we can determine exactly when two group elements are 
equal by using only these three relations). 
In general, if some group G is generated by a subset S$ and there is some collection 
of relations, say R,, R2,..., Ri» (here each R; is an equation in the elements from 
S U {1}) such that any relation among the elements of S can be deduced from these, we 
shall call these generators and relations a presentation of G and write 
G=(S|R1, Ro,..-, Rm). 
One presentation for the dihedral group D2, (using the generators and relations above) 
is then 
Do, = (r,s |r" =s? =1, rs =sr7'). (1.1) 
We shall see that using this presentation to describe D2, (rather than always reverting 
to the original geometric description) will greatly simplify working with these groups. 
Presentations give an easy way of describing many groups, but there are anumber of 
subtleties that need to be considered. One of these is that in an arbitrary presentation It 
may be difficult (or even impossible) to tell when two elements of the group (expressed 
in terms of the given generators) are equal. As a result it may not be evident what the 
order of the presented group is, or even whether the group is finite or infinitet For 
example, one can show that (x), y1 | x? = y? = (x)y1)? = 1) is a presentation of a 
group of order 4, whereas (x2, y2 | x3 = y3 = (x2y2)*? = 1) is a presentation of an 
infinite group (cf. the exercises). 
Another subtlety is that even in quite simple presentations, some “collapsing” may 
occur because the relations are intertwined in some unobvious way, 1.e., there may be 
“hidden,” or implicit, relations that are not explicitly given in the presentation but rather 
are consequences of the specified ones. This collapsing makes it difficult in general to 
determine even a lower bound for the size of the group being presented. For example, 
suppose one mimicked the presentation of D2, in an attempt to create another group by 
defining: 
Xo = (x,y |x" =y? = 1, xy = yx"). (1.2) 
The “commutation” relation xy = yx” determines how to commute y and x (i.e., how 
to “move” y from the right of x to the left), so that just as in the group D>, every element 
in this group can be written in the form yx! with all the powers of y on the left and all 
26 Chap.1 Introduction to Groups
the powers of x on the right. Also, by the first two relations any powers of x and y can be 
reduced so that i lies between O and n — 1 and k is O or 1. One might therefore suppose 
that X2, 1s again a group of order 2n. This is not the case because in this group there is 
a “hidden” relation obtained from the relation x = xy? (since y* = 1) by applying the 
commutation relation and the associative law repeatedly to move the y’s to the left: 
x = xy? = (xy)y = (yx”)y = (yx) (ry) = (yx) (yx7) 
= y(xy)x? = y(yx?)x? = y*x* = x4. 
Since x* = x it follows by the cancellation laws that x? = 1 in X2,, and from the 
discussion above it follows that X2,, has order at most 6 for any n. Even more collapsing 
may occur, depending on the value of n (see the exercises). 
As another example, consider the presentation 
Y=(u,v|ut=v=1, uv = vu"). (1.3) 
In this case it is tempting to guess that Y is a group of order 12, but again there are 
additional implicit relations. In fact this group Y degenerates to the trivial group of 
order 1, 1.e., u and v satisfy the additional relations uy = 1 and v = 1 (aproof ts outlined 
in the exercises). 
This kind of collapsing does not occur for the presentation of D2,, because we 
showed by independent (geometric) means that there is a group of order 2n with gen- 
erators r and s and satisfying the relations in (1). As a result, a group with only these 
relations must have order at least 2n. On the other hand, it 1s easy to see (using the 
same sort of argument for X2,, above and the commutation relation rs = sr—') that any 
group defined by the generators and relations in (1) has order at most 2n. It follows that 
the group with presentation (1) has order exactly 2n and also that this group is indeed 
the group of symmetries of the regular n—gon. 
The additional information we have for the presentation (1) is the existence of a 
group of known order satisfying this information. In contrast, we have no independent 
knowledge about any groups satisfying the relations in either (2) or (3). Without such 
independent “lower bound” information we might not even be able to determine whether 
a given presentation just describes the trivial group, as in (3). 
While in general it is necessary to be extremely careful in prescribing groups by 
presentations, the use of presentations for known groups is a powerful conceptual and 
computational tool. Additional results about presentations, including more elaborate 
examples, appear in Section 6.3. 
EXERCISES 
In these exercises, D2, has the usual presentation D2, = (r,s |r” = s*=1,rs=sr7! ).

Ineachof Exercises 9 to 13 you can find the order of the group of rigid motions in R? (also called 
the group of rotations) of the given Platonic solid by following the proof for the order of D2,: 
find the number of positions to which an adjacent pair of vertices can be sent. Alternatively, 
you can find the number of places to which a given face may be sent and, once a face is fixed, 
the number of positions to which a vertex on that face may be sent.

Chap.1 Introduction to Groups
1.3 SYMMETRIC GROUPS 
Let &2 be any nonempty set and let Sc be the set of all bijections from Q2 to itself (1.e., 
the set of all permutations of £2). The set So is a group under function composition: o. 
Note that o is a binary operation on So since ifo : Q — Qandt : 2 — Q are both 
bijections, then o o T 1s also a bijection from &2 to Q2. Since function composition is 
associative in general, o 1s associative. The identity of Sco is the permutation 1 defined 
by l(a) = a, forall a e€ &. For every permutation o there is a (2-sided) inverse 
function, o~! : Q > Q satisfying 0 oa0~! =a~'oo = 1. Thus, all the group axioms 
hold for (Sp, o). This group is called the symmetric group on the set §2. It is important 
to recognize that the elements of Sc are the permutations of &2, not the elements of 2 
itself. 
In the special case when Q = {1, 2, 3,..., nm}, the symmetric group on Q is de- 
noted S,,, the symmetric group of degree n.' The group S,, will play an important role 
throughout the text both as a group of considerable interest in its own right and as a 
means of illustrating and motivating the general theory. 
First we show that the order of S,, is n!. The permutations of {1, 2, 3,..., n} are 
precisely the injective functions of this set to itself because it is finite (Proposition 0.1) 
and we can count the number of injective functions. An injective function o can send 
the number | to any of the n elements of {1, 2, 3, ..., n}; o(2) can then be any one of 
the elements of this set except o (1) (so there are n — 1 choices for ao (2)); o (3) can be 
any element except o (1) or 0 (2) (so there are n — 2 choices for o(3)), and so on. Thus 
there are precisely n -(n — 1)-(n — 2)...2- 1 =n! possible injective functions from 
{1, 2, 3, ...,m} to itself. Hence there are precisely n! permutations of {1,2,3,..., n} 
so there are precisely n! elements in S,,. 
We now describe an efficient notation for writing elements o of S, which we shall 
use throughout the text and which is called the cycle decomposition. 
A cycle is a string of integers which represents the element of ,, which cyclically 
permutes these integers (and fixes all other integers). The cycle (a; a2 ... G,) is the 
permutation which sends a; to a;4;, 1 < i < m-— 1 and sends a,, to a,. For example 
(2 1 3) is the permutation which maps 2 to 1, 1 to 3 and 3 to 2. In general, for each 
o € §, the numbers from 1 to n will be rearranged and grouped into k cycles of the 
form 
(Qj a2... Am, (Amn +1 Om 42++- An.) cee (Any) +1 Om,_,+2--> Am,) 
from which the action of o on any number from 1 to n can easily be read, as follows. 
For any x € {1, 2, 3,...,n} first locate x in the above expression. If x is not followed 
immediately by a right parenthesis (1-.e., x is not at the nght end of one of the k cycles), 
then o (x) is the integer appearing immediately to the right of x. If x is followed by a 
right parenthesis, then o (x) is the number which is at the start of the cycle ending with 
x (1.e., if x = ay,, for some 7, then o(X) = Ayp,_,41 (where mo is taken to be 0)). We 
can represent this description of o by 
We shall see in Section 6 that the structure of Sg depends only on the cardinality of Q , not on the 
particular elements of © itself, so if Q is any finite set with n elements, then Sp “looks like” S,,.

The product of all the cycles is called the cycle decomposition of o. 
We now give an algorithm for computing the cycle decomposition of an element o 
of S, and work through the algorithm with a specific permutation. We defer the proof 
of this algorithm and full analysis of the uniqueness aspects of the cycle decomposition 
until Chapter 4. 
Let n = 13 and leto € Sj3 be defined by 
o(1)=12, o(f2) =13, o(3)=3, o(4) = 1, o(5) = 11, 
o(6)=9, o(7=5, o()=10, o(9)=6, oa (10) = 4, 
o(11)=7, o(12)=8, o(13) =2. 
Cycle Decomposition Algorithm 
Method Example 
To start a new cycle pick the smallest element of {1, 2,....”} | (1 
which has not yet appeared in a previous cycle — call it a (if 
you are just starting, a = 1); begin the new cycle: (a 
Read off o(a) from the given description of o — callit b. If | o(1) = 12 = b, 12 # 1 so write: 
b = a, close the cycle with a right parenthesis (without writing | (112 
b down); this completes a cycle — return to step 1. If b 4 a, 
write b nexttoa inthis cycle: (ab 
Read off o(b) from the given description of o — callitc. If | o(12) = 8, 8 $ 1 so continue the 
c = a, Close the cycle with a right parenthesis to complete the | cycle as: (1128 
cycle — return to step 1. If c # a, write c next to b in this 
cycle: (abc Repeat this step using the number c as the new 
value for b until the cycle closes. 
Naturally this process stops when all the numbers from {1, 2, ..., 1} have appeared 
in some cycle. For the particular o in the example this gives 
o = (1128 10 4)(2 13)(3)6 11 7)(6 9). 
The length of a cycle is the number of integers which appear in it. A cycle of length 
t is called a t-cycle. Two cycles are called disjoint if they have no numbers in common. 
30 Chap.1 Introduction to Groups 
Thus the element o above is the product of 5 (pairwise) disjoint cycles: a 5-cycle, a 
2-cycle, a 1-cycle, a 3-cycle, and another 2-cycle. 
Henceforth we adoptthe convention that 1-cycles will not be written. Thus if some 
integer, i, does not appear in the cycle decomposition of a permutation T it is understood 
that T(z) = i, 1-e., that t fixes i. The identity permutation of S,, has cycle decomposition 
(1)(2) ... (nm) and will be written simply as 1. Hence the final step of the algorithm ts: 
Cycle Decomposition Algorithm (cont.) 
Final Step: Remove all cycles of length 1 
The cycle decomposition for the particular o in the example is therefore 
o = (1128 104)(2 13) 117) 9) 
This convention has the advantage that the cycle decomposition of an element t of 
S, 1s also the cycle decomposition of the permutation in S,, for m > n which acts as T 
on {1, 2, 3, ..., nm} and fixes each element of {n + 1,n+ 2, ..., m}. Thus, for example, 
(1 2) is the permutation which interchanges 1 and 2 and fixes all larger integers.whether 
viewed in S$», $3 or $4, etc. 
As another example, the 6 elements of $3 havethe following cycle decompositions: 
The group $3 
Values of o; Cycle Decomposition of o; 
01 (1) = 1, 03 (2) = 2, 0) (3) =3 1 
o2(1) = 1, o2(2) = 3, 02(3) = 2 (2 3) 
03(1) = 3, 03(2) = 2, 03(3) = 1 (1 3) 
o4(1) = 2, 04(2) = 1, 04(3) = 3 (1 2) 
05(1) = 2, 05(2) = 3, o5(3) = 1 (1 2 3) 
For any o € S,, the cycle decomposition of o~! is obtained by writing the num- 
bers in each cycle of the cycle decomposition of o in reverse order. For example, if 
o = (1128 10 4)(2 13)(5 11 7)(6 9) is the element of 5,3 described before then 
ao! = (4108 12 1)(13 2)(7 11 5)(9 6). 
Computing products in S,, 1s straightforward, keeping in mind that when computing 
o oT in S, one reads the permutations from right to left. One simply “follows” the 
elements under the successive permutations. For example, in the product (1 2 3) o 
(1 2)(3 4) the number 1 is sent to 2 by the first permutation, then 2 is sent to 3 by 
the second permutation, hence the composite maps 1 to 3. To compute the cycle 
decomposition of the product we need next to see what happens to 3. It is sent first to 4, 
Sec. 1.3. Symmetric Groups 31 
then 4 is fixed, so 3 is mapped to 4 by the composite map. Similarly, 4 1s first mapped to 
3 then 3 is mapped to 1, completing this cycle in the product: (1 3 4). Finally, 2 is sent 
to 1, then 1 1s sent to 2 so 2 1s fixed by this product and so (1 2 3) 0 (1 2)(3 4) = (13 4) 
is the cycle decomposition of the product. 
As additional examples, 
(12) o (13) = (i 3 2) and Jd 3)0(1 2) = (1 2 3). 
In particular this shows that 
S, ts a non-abelian group for all n > 3. 
Each cycle (a; a2... ,,) inacycle decomposition can be viewed as the permutation 
which cyclically permutes a), a2,...,@ » and fixes all other integers. Since disjoint 
cycles permute numbers which lie in disjoint sets it follows that 
disjoint cycles commute. 
Thus rearranging the cycles in any product of disjoint cycles (in particular, in a cycle 
decomposition) does not change the permutation. 
Also, since a given cycle, (a; a2 ..-.Qm), permutes {a), Q2,..., Gm} cyclically, the 
numbers in the cycle itself can be cyclically permuted without altering the permutation, 
1.€., 
(A) A2...Am) = (G2 G3... Gy, A) = (43 A4...Am A QQ) =... 
= (Qyy QQ) Q2... Am_1).- 
Thus, for instance, (1 2) = (2 1) and (1 23 4) = (341 2). By convention, the smallest 
number appearing in the cycle is usually written first. 
One must exercise some care working with cycles since a permutation may be 
written in many ways as an arbitrary product of cycles. For instance, in $3, (1 2 3) = 
(1 2)(2 3) = (1 3)(1 3 2)C1 3) etc. But, (as we shall prove) the cycle decomposition of 
each permutation is the unique way of expressing a permutation as a product of disjoint 
cycles (up to rearranging its cycles and cyclically permuting the numbers within each 
cycle). Reducing an arbitrary product of cycles to a product of disjoint cycles allows 
us to determine at a glance whether or not two permutations are the same. Another 
advantage to this notation 1s that it is an exercise (outlined below) to prove that the order 
of a permutation ts the l.c.m. of the lengths of the cycles in its cycle decomposition.

1.4 MATRIX GROUPS 
In this section we introduce the notion of matrix groups where the coefficients come 
from fields. This example of a family of groups will be used for illustrative purposes 
in Part I and will be studied in more detail in the chapters on vector spaces. 
A field is the “smallest” mathematical structure in which we can perform all the 
arithmetic operations +, —, x, and + (division by nonzero elements), so in particular 
every nonzero element must have a multiplicative inverse. We shall study fields more 
thoroughly later and in this part of the text the only fields F we shall encounter will 
be Q, R and Z/pZ, where p is a prime. The example Z/pZ is a finite field, which, to 
emphasize that it is a field, we shall denote by F,. For the sake of completeness we 
include here the precise definition of a field. 
Definition. 
(1) A field is a set F together with two binary operations + and - on F such that 
(F, +) is an abelian group (call its identity 0) and (F' — {0}, -) 1s also an abelian 
group, and the following distributive law holds: 
a-(b+c)=(a-b)+(a-0o), forall a, b,c € F. 
(2) For any field F let F* = F — {0}. 
All the vector space theory, the theory of matrices and linear transformations and 
the theory of determinants when the scalars come from R is true, mutatis mutandis, 
when the scalars come from an arbitrary field F. When we use this theory in Part I we 
shall state explicitly what facts on fields we are assuming. 
Foreachn € Z* let GL, (F) be the set of all n x n matrices whose entries come 
from F and whose determinant is nonzero, i.e., 
GL,(F) = {A | Ais ann x n matrix with entries from F and det(A) £ 0 }, 
where the determinant of any matrix A with entries from F can be computed by the 
same formulas used when F = R. For arbitrary n x n matrices A and B let AB be the 
product of these matrices as computed by the same rules as when F = R. This product 
is associative. Also, since det(AB) = det(A) - det(B), it follows that if det(A) 4 0 
and det(B) + 0, then det(AB) 4 0, so GL,,(F) is closed under matrix multiplication. 
Furthermore, det(A) 4 0 if and only if A has a matrix inverse (and this inverse can be 
computed by the same adjoint formula used when F = R), so each A € GL, (F) has 
an inverse, A~!, in GL, (F): 
AA? =A A=], 
34 Chap.1 Introduction to Groups
where J is then x n identity matrix. Thus GL,,(F) is a group under matrix multipli- 
cation, called the general linear group of degree n. 
The following results willbe proved in Part III but are recorded now for convenience: 
(1) if F is a field and |F'| < co, then |F'| = p” for some prime p and integer m 
(2) if |F | =q < co, then |GL,(F)| = (q" — 1)(@" — 4)(q" — q*)...(@" —q""}).

the order formula in this section). [Subtract the number of 2 x 2 matrices which are not 
invertible from the total number of 2 x 2 matrices over F,. You may use the fact that a 
2 x 2 matrix is not invertible if and only if one row is a multiple of the other.]

(d) Prove that the set of elements of G whose two diagonal entries are equal (i.e., a = c)

The next exercise introduces the Heisenberg group over the field F and develops some of its 
basic properties. When F = R this group plays an important role in quantum mechanics 
and signal theory by giving a group theoretic interpretation (due to H. Weyl) of Heisenberg’s 
Uncertainty Principle. Note also that the Heisenberg group may be defined more generally — 
for example, with entries in Z.

1.5 THE QUATERNION GROUP 
The quaternion group, Qs, is defined by 
Qs = {1, —-1, i, —i, j, —j, k, —k} 
with product - computed as follows: 
l-a=a-l=a, foralla € Qg

i-i=j-jo=k-k=-1 
i-j=k, j:i=-—k 
jk =i, k-j=-i 
k-i=j, i-k=—-j 
As usual, we shall henceforth write ab for a - b. It is tedious to check the associative 
law (we shall prove this later by less computational means), but the other axioms are 
easily checked. Note that Qg is a non-abelian group of order 8. 
EXERCISES 
1. Compute the order of each of the elements in Qg. 
2. Write out the group tables for $3, Dg and Qg. 
3. Find a set of generators and relations for Qs. 
1.6 HOMOMORPHISMS AND ISOMORPHISMS 
In this section we make precise the notion of when two groups “look the same,” that is, 
have exactly the same group-theoretic structure. This is the notion of an isomorphism 
between two groups. We first define the notion of a homomorphism about which we 
shall have a great deal more to say later. 
Definition. Let (G, x) and (H, ©) be groups. A map g : G — FH such that 
g(x * y) = g(x) ogy), forallx, yEG 
is called a homomorphism. 
36 Chap.1 Introduction to Groups
When the group operations for G and H are not explicitly written, the homomor- 
phism condition becomes simply 
p(xy) = g(x) ¢(y) 
but it is important to keep in mind that the product xy on the left is computed in G 
and the product g(x)g(y) on the right is computed in H. Intuitively, a map ¢ is a 
homomorphism if it respects the group structures of its domain and codomain. 
Definition. The map ¢ : G —> 4 iscalled an isomorphism and G and H are said to 
be isomorphic or of the same isomorphism type, written G = H, if 
(1) gy is ahomomorphism (i.e., g(xy) = g(x) y(y)), and 
(2) ¢ is a bijection. 
In other words, the groups G and H are isomorphic if there is a bijection between 
them which preserves the group operations. Intuitively, G and H are the same group 
except that the elements and the operations may be written differently in G and H. 
Thus any property which G has which depends only on the group structure of G (i.e., 
can be derived from the group axioms — for example, commutativity of the group) also 
holds in H. Note that this formally justifies writing all our group operations as - since 
changing the symbol of the operation does not change the isomorphism type. 
Examples 
(1) For any group G, G = G. The identity map provides an obvious isomorphism but 
not, in general, the only isomorphism from G to itself. More generally, let G be 
any nonempty collection of groups. It is easy to check that the relation = is an 
equivalence relation on G and the equivalence classes are called isomorphism classes. 
This accounts for the somewhat symmetric wording of the definition of “isomorphism.” 
(2) The exponential map exp : R > Rt defined by exp(x) = e*, where e is the base of 
the natural logarithm, is an isomorphism from (R, +) to (Rt, x). Exp is a bijection 
since it has an inverse function (namely log, ) and exp preserves the group operations 
since e* + — e*e”. In thisexample both the elements and the operations are different 
yet the two groups are isomorphic, that is, as groups they have identical structures. 
(3) In this example we show that the isomorphism type of a symmetric group depends 
only on the cardinality of the underlying set being permuted. 
Let A and & be nonempty sets. The symmetric groups S, and Sg are isomorphic 
if |A| = |&2|. We can see this intuitively as follows: given that |A| = |Q|, there is a 
bijection 6 from A onto &. Think of the elements of A and & as being glued together 
via 6, i.e., each x € A is glued to 6(x) € Q. Toobtainamap g : Sa > Sg leto € Sa 
be a permutation of A and let g(o) be the permutation of 2 which moves the elements 
of &2 in the same way o moves the corresponding glued elements of A; that is, if 
o(x) = y,forsome x, y € A, then g(o)(@(x)) = 6(y) in &. Since the set bijection 6 
has an inverse, one can easily check that the map between symmetric groups also has 
aninverse. The precise technical definition of the map ¢ and the straightforward, albeit 
tedious, checking of the properties which ensure ¢g is an isomorphism are relegated to 
the following exercises. 
Conversely, if Sa = Se, then |A| = |82]; we prove this only when the underlying 
Sec. 1.6 Homomorphisms and lsomorphisms 37
sets are finite (when both A and © are infinite sets the proof is harder and will be 
given as an exercise in Chapter 4). Since any isomorphism between two groups G 
and # is, a priori, a bijection between them, a necessary condition for isomorphism 
is |SA| = |SQ|. When A is a finite set of order n, then |Sa| = n!. We actually only 
proved this for S,, however the same reasoning applies for S,. Similarly, if Q is a 
finite set of order m, then |ScQ| = m!. Thus if Sa and Sg are isomorphic then n! = m!}, 
som =n, i.e., [A] = |Q|. 
Many more examples of isomorphisms will appear throughout the text. When 
we study different structures (rings, fields, vector spaces, etc.) we shall formulate 
corresponding notions of isomorphisms between respective structures. One of the 
central problems in mathematics is to determine what properties of a structure specify 
its isomorphism type (i.e., to prove that if G is an object with some structure (such as a 
group) and G has property ?, then any other similarly structured object (group) X with 
property P is isomorphic to G). Theorems of this type are referred to as classification 
theorems. For example, we shall prove that 
any non-abelian group of order 6 is isomorphic to 83 
(so here G is the group S3 and P is the property “non-abelian and of order 6”). From 
this classification theorem we obtain Dg = S3 and GL2(F2) = $3 without having to 
find explicit maps between these groups. Note that it is not true that any group of order 
6 is isomorphic to $3. In fact we shall prove that up to isomorphism there are precisely 
two groups of order 6: S3 and Z/6Z (1.e., any group of order 6 is isomorphic to one 
of these two groups and $3 is not isomorphic to Z/6Z). Note that the conclusion is 
less specific (there are two possible types); however, the hypotheses are easier to check 
(namely, check to see if the order is 6). Results of the latter type are also referred to as 
classifications. Generally speaking it is subtle and difficult, even in specific instances, 
to determine whether or not two groups (or other mathematical objects) are isomorphic 
— constructing an explicit map between them which preserves the group operations 
or proving no such map exists is, except in tiny cases, computationally unfeasible as 
indicated already in trying to prove the above classification of groups of order 6 without 
further theory. 
It is occasionally easy to see that two given groups are not isomorphic. For example, 
the exercises below assert that if ¢ : G — A is an isomorphism, then, in particular, 
(a) |G| =|A| 
(b) G is abelian if and only if H is abelian 
(c) for all x € G, |x| = |g(x)|. 
Thus $3 and Z/6Z are not isomorphic (as indicated above) since one is abelian and the 
other is not. Also, (R—{0}, x) and (R, +) cannot be isomorphic because in (R—{0}, x) 
the element —1 has order 2 whereas (R, +) has no element of order 2, contrary to (c). 
Finally, we record one very useful fact that we shall prove later (when we discuss 
free groups) dealing with the question of homomorphisms and isomorphisms between 
two groups given by generators and relations: 
Let G be a finite group of order n for which we have a presentation and let 
S = {s1,.-.-., 5m} be the generators. Let H be another group and {7), ...,1,,} be el- 
ements of H. Suppose that any relation satisfied in G by the s; is also satisfied in H 
38 Chap. 1 Introduction to Groups
when each s; is replaced by r;. Then there is a (unique) homomorphism g : G > H 
which maps s; to r;. If we have a presentation for G, then we need only check the 
relations specified by this presentation (since, by definition of a presentation, every 
relation can be deduced from the relations given in the presentation). If H is generated 
by the elements {7;, ..., 7}, then g is surjective (any product of the r;’s is the image 
of the corresponding product of the s;’s). If, in addition, H has the same (finite) or- 
der as G, then any surjective map is necessarily injective, i.e., g is an isomorphism: 
G = H. Intuitively, we can map the generators of G to any elements of H and obtain 
a homomorphism provided that the relations in G are still satisfied. 
Readers may already be familiar with the corresponding statement for vector spaces. 
Suppose V is a finite dimensional vector space of dimension n with basis S and W is 
another vector space. Then we can specify a linear transformation from V to W by 
mapping the elements of S to arbitrary vectors in W (here there are no relations to 
satisfy). If W is also of dimension n and the chosen vectors in W span W (and so are a 
basis for W) then this linear transformation is invertible (a vector space isomorphism). 
Examples 
(1) Recall that Dz, = (r,s |r” =s? =1, sr =r—'s). Suppose H is a group containing 
elements a and b with a” = 1,b? = 1 andba = a™'b. Then thereis a homomorphism 
from D2, to H mapping r to a and s to b. For instance, let k be an integer dividing n 
with k > 3 and let Do, = (r1, 51 | rf = s? =1,sirn= ris ). Define 
gy: Do, Dy by g(r) =n andg(s) =s}. 
If we write n = km, then since rf = I, alsor} = (ri y” = 1. Thus the three relations 
satisfied by r, s in D2, are satisfied by r;, 51 in D2,. Thus g extends (uniquely) to a 
homomorphism from D2, to D2,. Since {r1, s;} generates D2;, gy is surjective. This 
homomorphism is not an isomorphism if k < n. 
(2) Following up on the preceding example, let G = D¢ beas presented above. Check 
that in H = S3 the elements a = (1 23) and b = (1 2) satisfy the relations: a> =1, 
b? = 1 and ba = ab™!. Thus there is a homomorphism from D¢ to 83 which sends 
r+» aands t+» b. One may further check that S3 is generated by a and b, so this 
homomorphism is surjective. Since De and $3 both have order 6, this homomorphism 
is an isomorphism: Dg = $3. 
Note that the element a in the examples above need not have order n (i.e., n need 
not be the smallest power of a giving the identity in H) and similarly b need not have 
order 2 (for example b could well be the identity if a = a~'). This allows us to more 
easily construct homomorphisms and is in keeping with the idea that the generators and 
relations fora group G constitute a complete set of data for the group structure of G.

1.7 GROUP ACTIONS 
In this section we introduce the precise definition of a group acting on a set and present 
some examples. Group actions will be a powerful tool which we shall use both for 
proving theorems for abstract groups and for unravelling the structure of specific ex- 
amples. Moreover, the concept of an “action” is a theme which will recur throughout 
the text as a method for studying an algebraic object by seeing how it can act on other 
structures. 
Definition. A group action of a group G on a set A is amap from G x A to A (written 
as g-a, for all g € G anda € A) satisfying the following properties: 
(1) 21-(g2-a) = (g182)-a, forall g1, 22 € G,a € A, and 
(2) l-a=a, forallaeé A. 
Sec. 1.7 Group Actions 41
We shall immediately become less formal and say G is a group acting on a set A. 
The expression g-a will usually be written simply as ga when there is no danger of 
confusing this map with, say, the group operation (remember, -is not a binary operation 
and ga is always a member of A). Note that on the left hand side of the equation in 
property (1) g2-a is an element of A so it makes sense to act on this by g;. On the 
right hand side of this equation the product (g; g2) is taken in G and the resulting group 
element acts on the set element a. 
Before giving some examples of group actions we make some observations. Let 
the group G act on the set A. For each fixed g € G we get a map o, defined by 
0o,:A->A 
0,(a) = g-a. 
We prove two important facts: 
(i) for each fixed g € G, o, is a permutation of A, and 
(ii) the map from G to S, defined by g +> o, is a homomorphism. 
To see that o, is a permutation of A we show that as a set map from A to A it has a 
2-sided inverse, namely o,-: (it is then a permutation by Proposition 1 of Section 0.1). 
Forallae A 
(6,-1 0 Og)(a) = O,-1(0,(a)) (by definition of function composition) 
= g! -(g-a) (by definition of o,-1 and o,) 
= (g! g)-a (by property (1) of an action) 
=l-a=a (by property (2) of an action). 
This proves o,-1 0 o, is the identity map from A to A. Since g was arbitrary, we may 
interchange the roles of g and g7! to obtain o, 0 o,- is also the identity map on A. 
Thus o, has a 2-sided inverse, hence is a permutation of A. 
To check assertion (ii) above let gy : G — Sy, be defined by y(g) = o,. Note that 
part (i) shows that o, is indeed an element of S,. To see that g is a homomorphism 
we must prove ¢(g;22) = ¢(g1) © ¢(g2) (recall that S, 1s a group under function 
composition). The permutations ¢(g) g2) and ¢(g1) o ¢(g2) are equal if and only if their 
values agree on every element a € A. Forallae A 
9(2182)(@) = Og, (a) (by definition of ¢) 
= (8182)-4 (by definition of o¢,2,) 
= 81-(g2-a) (by property (1) of an action) 
= 04, (0,, (a@)) (by definition of o,, and o,,) 
= (9(81) 0 (g2))(a) ~— (by definition of ¢). 
This proves assertion (i1) above. 
Intuitively, a group action of G on aset A just means that every element g in G acts 
as a permutation on A in amanner consistent with the group operations in G; assertions 
(i) and (11) above make this precise. The homomorphism from G to S,4 given above is 
42 Chap. 1 Introduction to Groups
called the permutation representation associated to the given action. It is easy to see 
that this process is reversible in the sense that if g : G > Sx, is any homomorphism 
from a group G to the symmetric group on a set A, then the map from G x A to A 
defined by 
g-a=¢(g)(a) forall g € G, andallaeA 
satisfies the properties of a group action of G on A. Thus actions of a group G ona 
set A and the homomorphisms from G into the symmetric group S, are in bijective 
correspondence (1.e., are essentially the same notion, phrased in different terminology). 
We should also note that the definition of an action might have been more precisely 
named a /eft action since the group elements appear on the left of the set elements. We 
could similarly define the notion of a right action. 
Examples 
Let G be a group and A a nonempty set. In each of the following examples the check of 
properties (1) and (2) of an action are left as exercises. 
(1) Let ga = a, forall g € G,a € A. Properties (1) and (2) of a group action follow 
immediately. This action is called the trivial action and G 1s said to act trivially on 
A. Note that distinct elements of G induce the same permutation on A (in this case 
the identity permutation). The associated permutation representation G > Sz, is the 
trivial homomorphism which maps every element of G to the identity. 
If G acts on a set B and distinct elements of G induce distinct permutations of 
B, the action is said to be faithful. A faithful action is therefore one in which the 
associated permutation representation is injective. 
The kernel of the action of G on B is defined to be {g € G | gb = b forallb € B}, 
namely the elements of G which fix all the elements of B. For the trivial action, the 
kernel of the action is all of G and this action is not faithful when |G| > 1. 
(2) The axioms for a vector space V over a field F include the two axioms that the 
multiplicative group F™* act on the set V. Thus vector spaces are familiar examples 
of actions of multiplicative groups of fields where there is even more structure (in 
particular, V must be an abelian group) which can be exploited. In the special case 
when V = R” and F = R the action Is specified by 
a(r},12..-.,%m) = (ar), Mr2,..-.QTn) 
for alla € R, (%,72,...,%) € RR", where a7; is just multiplication of two real 
numbers. 
(3) For any nonempty set A the symmetric group S, acts on A by o-a = o(a), for all 
o € Sa,a € A. The associated permutation representation 1s the identity map from 
S4 to itself. 
(4) If we fix a labelling of the vertices of a regular n-gon, each element a of D2,, gives 
rise to a permutation og of {1,2,..., n} by the way the symmetry a permutes the 
corresponding vertices. The map of D2, x {1,2,...,n} onto {1, 2,...,n} defined 
by (a, i) — og(i) defines a group action of D2, on {1,2,...,n}. In keeping with 
our notation for group actions we can now dispense with the formal and cumbersome 
notation o, (i) and write ai in its place. Note that this action is faithful: distinct 
symmetries of a regular n-gon induce distinct permutations of the vertices. 
When n = 3 the action of De on the three (labelled) vertices of a triangle gives 
an injective homomorphism from D¢ to S3. Since these groups have the same order, 
this map must also be surjective, 1.e., is an isomorphism: Dg = S3. This is another 
Sec. 1.7. Group Actions 43
proof of the same fact we established via generators and relations in the preceding 
section. Geometrically it says that any permutation of the vertices of a triangle is a 
symmetry. The analogous statement is not true for any n-gon withn > 4 (just by order 
considerations we cannot have D2, isomorphic to S,, for any n > 4). 
(5) Let G be any group and let A = G. Define a map from G x A to A by g-a = ga, 
for each g € G anda € A, where ga on the right hand side is the product of g and 
a in the group G. This gives a group action of G on itself, where each (fixed) g € G 
permutes the elements of G by left multiplication: 
g:at ga foralla eG 
(or, if G is written additively, we get a + g +a and call this left translation). This 
action is called the left regular action of G on itself. By the cancellation laws, this 
action is faithful (check this). 
Other examples of actions are given in the exercises. we

the sets {1, 2} and {2, 1} are the same, so the sets being acted upon are different).

CHAPTER 2 
Subgroups 
2.1 DEFINITION AND EXAMPLES 
One basic method for unravelling the structure of any mathematical object which is 
defined by a set of axioms is to study subsets of that object which also satisfy the 
same axioms. We begin this program by discussing subgroups of a group. A second 
basic method for unravelling structure is to study quotients of an object; the notion of 
a quotient group, which is a way (roughly speaking) of collapsing one group onto a 
smaller group, will be dealt with in the next chapter. Both of these themes will recur 
throughout the text as we study subgroups and quotient groups of a group, subrings and 
quotient rings of a ring, subspaces and quotient spaces of a vector space, etc. 
Definition. Let G bea group. The subset H of G is a subgroup of G if H is nonempty 
and H is closed under products and inverses (i.e., x, y € H implies x~'! € H and 
xy € A). If H isa subgroup of G we shall write H < G. 
Subgroups of G are just subsets of G which are themselves groups with respect 
to the operation defined in G, i.e., the binary operation on G restricts to give a binary 
operation on H which is associative, has an identity in H, and has inverses in H for all 
the elements of H. 
When we say that H is a subgroup of G we shall always mean that the operation 
for the group H is the operation on G restricted to H (in general it is possible that the 
subset H has the structure of a group with respect to some operation other than the 
operation on G restricted to H, cf. Example 5(a) following). As we have been doing for 
functions restricted to a subset, we shall denote the operation for G and the operation 
for the subgroup H by the same symbol. If H < G and H # G we shall write H <G 
to emphasize that the containment is proper. 
If H is a subgroup of G then, since the operation for H is the operation for G 
restricted to H, any equation in the subgroup H may also be viewed as an equation in 
the group G. Thus the cancellation laws for G imply that the identity for H is the same 
as the identity of G (in particular, every subgroup must contain 1, the identity of G) 
and the inverse of an element x in H/ is the same as the inverse of x when considered 
as an element of G (so the notation x~! is unambiguous). 
46
Examples 
(l) Z < Qand Q < R with the operation of addition. 
(2) Any group G has two subgroups: H = G and H = {1}; the latter 1s called the trivial 
subgroup and will henceforth be denoted by 1. 
(3) If G = Dy», is the dihedral group of order 2n, let H be {1, r, r2,...,r"—!}, the set of 
all rotations in G. Since the product of two rotations is again a rotation and the inverse 
of a rotation is also a rotation it follows that H is a subgroup of D2, of order n. 
(4) The set of even integers is a subgroup of the group of all integers under addition. 
(5) Some examples of subsets which are not subgroups: 
(a) Q — {0} under multiplication is not a subgroup of R under addition even though 
both are groups and Q — {0} is a subset of IR; the operation of multiplication on 
Q — {0} is not the restriction of the operation of addition on R. 
(b) Zt (under addition) is not a subgroup of Z (under addition) because although 
Z* is closed under +, it does not contain the identity, 0, of Z and although each 
x € Zt has an additive inverse, —x, in Z, —x ¢ Z* ,i.e., Zt is not closed under 
the operation of taking inverses (in particular, Zt is not a group under addition). 
For analogous reasons, (Z — {0}, x) is not a subgroup of (Q — {0}, x). 
(c) De isnot a subgroup of Dg since the former is not even a subset of the latter. 
(6) The relation “is a subgroup of” is transitive: if H is a subgroup of a group G and K 
is a subgroup of H, then K is also a subgroup of G. 
As we saw in Chapter 1, even for easy examples checking that all the group axioms 
(especially the associative law) hold for any given binary operation can be tedious at 
best. Once we know that we have a group, however, checking that a subset of it is (or 
is not) a subgroup is a much easier task, since all we need to check is closure under 
multiplication and under taking inverses. The next proposition shows that these can be 
amalgamated into a single test and also shows that for finite groups it suffices to check 
for closure under multiplication. 
Proposition 1. (The Subgroup Criterion) A subset H of a group G is a subgroup if and 
only if 
(1) H #@, and 
(2) forallx,ye¢ H,xy eH. 
Furthermore, if H is finite, then it suffices to check that H is nonempty and closed 
under multiplication. 
Proof: If H is a subgroup of G, then certainly (1) and (2) hold because H contains 
the identity of G and the inverse of each of its elements and because H is closed under 
multiplication. 
It remains to show conversely thatif H satisfies both (1) and (2), then H < G. Let 
x be any element in H (such x exists by property (1)). Let y = x and apply property 
(2) to deduce that 1 = xx—! € H, so H contains the identity of G. Then, again by (2), 
since H contains 1 and x, H contains the element 1x~!, i.e., x~! € H and H isclosed 
under taking inverses. Finally, if x and y are any two elements of H, then H contains 
x and y—! by what we have just proved, so by (2), H also contains x(y~')~! = xy. 
Hence H is also closed under multiplication, which proves H is a subgroup of G. 
Sec. 2.1. Definition and Examples 47
Suppose now that #7 1s finite and closed under multiplication and let x be any 
element in H. Then there are only finitely many distinct elements among x, x”, x7, ... 
and so x? = x? for some integers a, b with b > a. If n = b — a, then x” = 1 soin 
particular every element x € H is of finite order. Then x""! = x~! is an element of H, 
so H is automatically also closed under inverses.

2.2 CENTRALIZERS AND NORMALIZERS, STABILIZERS AND KERNELS 
We now introduce some important families of subgroups of an arbitrary group G which 
in particular provide many examples of subgroups. Let A be any nonempty subset 
of G. 
Definition. Define Cg(A) = {g € G | gag! = a for alla € A}. This subset of G 
is called the centralizer of Ain G. Since gag—! = a if and only if ga = ag, Cc(A) is 
the set of elements of G which commute with every element of A. 
We show Cc (A) is a subgroup of G. First of all, Cg(A) 4 @ because 1 € Cg(A): 
the definition of the identity specifies that la = al, for all a € G (in particular, for 
all a € A) so 1 satisfies the defining condition for membership in Cg(A). Secondly, 
assume x, y € Cc(A), that is, for alla € A, xax~! = a and yay! = a (note that 
this does not mean xy = yx). Observe first that since yay~'! = a, multiplying both 
sides of this first on the left by y~!, then on the right by y and then simplifying gives 
a = y~!ay,i.e., y-! € Cg(A) so that Cg(A) is closed under taking inverses. Now 
(xy)a(xy)7) = (xy)a(y!x71) (by Proposition 1.1(4) applied to (xy)! ) 
= x(yay !)x7! (by the associative law) 
= xax"! (since y € Cc(A) ) 
=a (since x € Cc(A) ) 
so xy € Cg(A) and Cg (A) is closed under products, hence Cg(A) < G. 
In the special case when A = {a} we shall write simply Cg(a) instead of Cg ({a}). 
In this case a” € Cc(a) forall n € Z. 
Sec. 2.2. Centralizers and Normalizers, Stabilizers and Kernels 49
For example, in an abelian group G, Cg(A) = G, for all subsets A. One can 
check by inspection that Cg, (7) = {+1, +i}. Some other examples are specified in the 
exercises. 
We shall shortly discuss how to minimize the calculation of commutativities be- 
tween single group elements which appears to be inherent in the computation of cen- 
tralizers (and other subgroups of a similar nature). 
Definition. Define Z(G) = {g € G| gx = xg forall x € G}, the set of elements 
commuting with all the elements of G. This subset of G 1s called the center of G. 
Note that Z(G) = Cg(G), so the argument above proves Z(G) < G as a special 
case. As an exercise, the reader may wish to prove Z(G) is a subgroup directly. 
Definition. Define gAg™! = {gag™! | a € A}. Define the normalizer of A in G to 
be the set Ng(A) = {g € G| gAg™! = A}. 
Notice thatif g € Cg(A), then gag”! =a € A foralla € AsoCg(A) < NG(A). 
The proof that NG(A) 1s a subgroup of G follows the same steps which demonstrated 
that Cg(A) < G with appropriate modifications. 
Examples 
(1) If Gis abelian then all the elements of G commute, so Z(G) = G. Similarly, Cg (A) = 
NG(A) = G for any subset A of G since gag! = gg—'a = a forevery g € G and 
every a € A. 
(2) Let G = Dg be the dihedral group of order 8 with the usual generators r and s and 
let A = {1,r,r7, r>} be the subgroup of rotations in Dg. We show that Cp, (A) = A. 
Since all powers of r commute with each other, A < Cp,(A). Since sr = ras Z rs 
the element s does not commute with all members of A, i.e., s ¢ Cp, (A). Finally, the 
elements of Dg that are not in A are all of the form sr' for some i € {0, 1, 2,3}. If 
the element sr’ were in Cp, (A) then since Cp, (A) is a subgroup which contains r we 
would also have the element s = (sr')(r—') in C p,(A), a contradiction. This shows 
Cp, (A) = A. . 
(3) As in the preceding example let G = Dg and let A = {1,7, r2,r3}. We show that 
Np, (A) = Dg. Since, in general, the centralizer of a subset is contained in its nor- 
malizer, A < Np,(A). Next compute that 
sAs—! = {sls—!, srs—!, sr*s—, srs!) = 1, 7°, r?, N=A, 
sothats € Np, (A). (Note that the set sAs I equals the set A even though the elements 
in these two sets appear in different orders — this is because s is in the normalizer of 
A but not in the centralizer of A.) Now both r and s belong to the subgroup Np, (A) 
and hence s'rJ € N p,(A) for all integers i and j, that is, every element of Dg is in 
Np, (A) (recall that r ands generate Dg). Since Dg < Np,(A) wehave Np,(A) = Dg 
(the reverse containment being obvious from the definition of a normalizer). 
(4) We show that the center of Dg is the subgroup {1, r*}. First observe that the center 
of any group G is contained in Cg(A) for any subset A of G. Thus by Example 2 
above Z(Dg) < Cp,(A) = A, where A = {1,,r, r*,r>}. The calculation in Example 
2 shows that r and similarly r? are not in Z(Dg), so Z(Dg) < {1,r2}. To show the 
50 Chap.2 Subgroups
reverse inclusion note that r commutes with r2 and calculate that s also commutes 
with r2. Since r and s generate Dg, every element of Dg commutes with r (and 1), 
hence {1, r2} < Z(Dg) and so equality holds. 
(5) Let G = S83 and let A be the subgroup {1, (12)}. We explain why Cs, (A) = Ns, (A) = 
A. One can compute directly that Cs,(A) = A, using the ideas in Example 2 above to 
minimize the calculations. Alternatively, since an element commutes with its powers, 
A < Cs,(A). By Lagrange’s Theorem (Exercise 19 in Section 1.7) the order of the 
subgroup Cs, (A) of S3 divides |53| = 6. Also by Lagrange’s Theorem applied to the 
subgroup A of the group Cs, (A) we have that 2 | |Cs,(A)|. The only possibilities 
are: |Cs,(A)| = 2 or 6. If the latter occurs, Cs,(A) = $3, 1.e., A < Z(S3); this is a 
contradiction because (1 2) does not commute with (1 2 3). Thus |Cs,(A)| = 2 and so 
A = Cs, (A). 
Next note that Ns,(A) = A because o € Ns, (A) if and only if 
{olo—!, o(12)o7'} = {1, (12)}. 
Since olo—! = 1, this equality of sets occurs if and only if o(1 2)o~! = (12) as 
well, i.e., if and only ifo € Cs, (A). 
The center of S3 is the identity because Z(S3) < Cs,(A) = A and (12) ¢ Z(S3). 
Stabilizers and Kernels of Group Actions 
The fact that the normalizer of A in G, the centralizer of A in G, and the center of G 
are all subgroups can be deduced as special cases of results on group actions, indicating 
that the structure of G 1s reflected by the sets on which it acts, as follows: if G isa 
group acting on a set S and s 1s some fixed element of S, the stabilizer of s in G 1s the 
set 
G,={geG|eg-s=s} 
(see Exercise 4 1n Section 1.7). We show briefly that G, < G: first | € G, by axiom 
(2) of an action. Also, if y € Gs, 
s=1-s=(y'y):s 
=y!.(y-s) (by axiom (1) of an action ) 
=yl.s (since y € G,) 
so y—! € G, as well. Finally, if x, y € Gs, then 
(xy)-s=x-(y-s) (by axiom (1) of an action) 
=x-s (since y € G,) 
=S§ (since x € Gs). 
This proves G, is a subgroup! of G. A similar (but easier) argument proves that the 
kernel of an action is a subgroup, where the kernel of the action of G on S 1s defined as 
{g€G|g-s=s, foralls € S} 
(see Exercise 1 1n Section 1.7). 
Notice how the steps to prove G, is a subgroup are the same as those to prove Cc(A) < G with 
axiom (1) of an action taking the place of the associative law. 
Sec. 2.2. Centralizers and Normalizers, Stabilizers and Kernels 51
Examples 
(1) The group G = Dg acts on the set A of four vertices of a square (cf. Example 4 in 
Section 1.7). The stabilizer of any vertex a is the subgroup {1, ¢} of Dg, where ¢ is 
the reflection about the line of symmetry passing through vertex a and the center of 
the square. The kernel of this action is the identity subgroup since only the identity 
symmetry fixes every vertex. 
(2) The group G = Dg also acts on the set A whose elements are the two unordered pairs 
of opposite vertices (in the labelling of Figure 2 in Section 1.2, A = { {1, 3}, {2, 4} }). 
Thekernel of the action of Dg on this set A is the subgroup {1, s, r?, sr2} and for either 
element a € A the stabilizer of a in Dg equals the kernel of the action. 
Finally, we observe that the fact that centralizers, normalizers and kernels are sub- 
groups is a special case of the facts that stabilizers and kernels of actions are subgroups 
(this will be discussed further in Chapter 4). Let § = ?(G), the collection of all subsets 
of G, and let G act on S by conjugation, that is, foreach g € G and each B C G let 
g:B— gBg! where gBg' ={gbg!|be B} 
(see Exercise 16 in Section 1.7). Under this action, it is easy to check that NG(A) is 
precisely the stabilizer of A in G (1.e., NG(A) = Gs, where s = A € P(G)), so NG(A) 
is a subgroup of G. 
Next let the group Ng(A) act onthe set §S = A by conjugation, 1.e., for all g € 
Nc(A) andaeA 
R:abr gag}. 
Note that this does map A to A by the definition of Ng(A) and so gives an action on 
A. Here it is easy to check that Cg(A) is precisely the kernel of this action, hence 
Cc(A) < Ng(A),; by transitivity of the relation “<,’ Cg(A) < G. Finally, Z(G) is the 
kernel of G acting on S = G by conjugation, so Z(G) < G.

2.3 CYCLIC GROUPS AND CYCLIC SUBGROUPS 
Let G be any group and let x be any element of G. One way of forming a subgroup H 
of G is by letting H be the set of all integer (positive, negative and zero) powers of x 
(this guarantees closure under inverses and products at least as far as x is concerned). 
In this section we study groups which are generated by one element. 
Definition. A group H is cyclic if H can be generated by a single element, i.e., there 
is some element x € H such that H = {x” | n € Z} (where as usual the operation is 
multiplication). 
In additive notation H is cyclic if H = {nx | n € Z}. In both cases we shall write 
H = (x) and say H is generated by x (and x is a generator of H). A cyclic group 
may have more than one generator. For example, if H = (x), then also H = (x7) 
because (x~!)” = x~" and as n runs over all integers so does —n so that 
{x" ]n EZ} ={(x!)" |n eZ}. 
We shall shortly show how to determine all generators for a given cyclic group H. One 
should note that the elements of (x) are powers of x (or multiples of x, in groups 
written additively) and not integers. It is not necessarily true that all powers of x are 
distinct. Also, by the laws for exponents (Exercise 19 in Section 1.1) cyclic groups are 
abelian. 
Examples 
(1) Let G = Do, = (7,5 |r” = 5s? = 1, rs = sr—!), n > 3 and let H be the subgroup 
of all rotations of the n-gon. Thus H = (r) and the distinct elements of H are 
l,r,r?,...,r%7! (these are all the distinct powers of r). In particular, |H| = n and 
the generator, r, of H has order n. The powers of r “cycle” (forward and backward) 
with period n, that is, 
In general, to write any power of r, say r', in the form r*, for some k between 0 and 
n — 1 use the Division Algorithm to write 
t=nqgt+k, where 0 < k <n, 
so that 
rh a Pk — (My ak — ark — pk, 
For example, in Dg, r4 = 1 so r!® = ,4@6)+1 = > and r-42 = rA(- 142 = /?2, 
Observe that D2,, itself is not a cyclic group since it is non-abelian. 
(2) Let H = Z with operation +. Thus H = (1) (here 1 is the integer 1 and the identity 
of H is 0) and each element in H can be written uniquely in the form n - 1, for some 
n € Z. Incontrast to the preceding example, multiples of the generator are all distinct 
and we need to take both positive, negative and zero multiples of the generator to 
obtain all elements of H. In this example |H| and the order of the generator 1 are 
both oo. Note also that H = (—1) since each integer x can be written (uniquely) as 
(—x)(—1). 
54 Chap.2 Subgroups
Before discussing cyclic groups further we prove that the various properties of finite 
and infinite cyclic groups we observed in the preceding twoexamples are generic. This 
proposition also validates the claim (in Chapter 1) that the use of the terminology for 
“order” of an element and the use of the symbol | | are consistent with the notion of 
order of a set. 
Proposition 2. If H = (x), then |H| = |x| (where if one side of this equality is 
infinite, so is the other). More specifically 
(1) if|H| =n < oo,thenx” = land1, x, x?,..., x"! are all the distinct elements 
of H, and 
(2) if |H| = 00, then x” #4 1 foralln 4 O and x? 4 x foralla £ bin Z. 
Proof: Let |x| = n and first consider the case when n < oo. The elements 
1,x,x?,...,x"7! are distinct because if x* = x’, with, say, 0 < a < b < n, then 
x°-4 — x° = 1, contrary ton being the smallest positive power of x giving the identity. 
Thus H has at least n elements and it remains to show that these are all of them. As we 
did in Example 1, if x’ isany power of x, use the Division Algorithm to write t = ng +k, 
where 0 < k <n, so 
xf = xtatk — (x")ax* = 1%7xk = xk | {1, x,x7,... xr ty, 
as desired. 
Next suppose |x| = © so no positive power of x is the identity. If x* = x?, for 
some a and b with, say, a < b, then x°-* = 1, acontradiction. Distinct powers of x 
are distinct elements of H so|H| = oo. This completes the proof of the proposition. 
Note that the proof of the proposition gives the method for reducing arbitrary 
powers of a generator in a finite cyclic group to the “least residue” powers. It is not a 
coincidence that the calculations of distinct powers of a generator of a cyclic group of 
order n are carried out via arithmetic in Z/nZ. Theorem 4 following proves that these 
two groups are isomorphic. 
First we need an easy proposition. 
Proposition 3. Let G be an arbitrary group, x € G and let m,n € Z. If x” = 1 and 
x” = 1, then x? = 1, whered = (m,n). In particular, if x” = 1 for some m € Z, then 
|x| divides m. 
Proof: By the Euclidean Algorithm (see Section 0.2 (6)) there exist integers r and 
s such that d = mr + ns, where d is the g.c.d. of m and n. Thus 
x? _ ytrtns — (x (x"ys —1'1' =1. 
This proves the first assertion. 
If x” = 1, letn = |x|. If m =O, certainly n | m, SO We may assume m + O. Since 
some nonzero power of x is the identity, n < oo, Let d = (m, n) so by the preceding 
result x? = 1. Since 0 < d < nand n is the smallest positive power of x which gives 
the identity, we must have d = n, that is, n | m, as asserted. 
Sec. 2.3 Cyclic Groups and Cyclic Subgroups 55
Theorem 4. Any two cyclic groups of the same orderare isomorphic. More specifically, 
(1) ifn € Zt and (x) and (y) are both cyclic groups of order n, then the map 
g:(x)—> (y) 
xk be yk 
is well defined and is an isomorphism 
(2) if (x) is an infinite cyclic group, the map 
g:Z— (x) 
kr xt 
is well defined and is an isomorphism. 
Proof: Suppose (x ) and ( y ) are both cyclic groups of ordern. Letg : (x) > (y) 
be defined by y(x*) = y*; we must first prove ¢ is well defined, that is, 
if x’ = x*, then g(x") = g(x’). 
Since x’~* = 1, Proposition 3 implies n | r—s. Writer =tn+s so 
g(x") = g(x'"**) 
This proves ¢ is well defined. Itisimmediate from the laws ofexponents that y(x2x°) = 
¢(x*)p(x") (check this), that is, g is a homomorphism. Since the element y* of ( y) 
is the image of x* under g, this map is surjective. Since both groups have the same 
finite order, any surjection from one to the other is a bijection, so g is an isomorphism 
(alternatively, g has an obvious two-sided inverse). 
If (x) is an infinite cyclic group, let g : Z — (x) be defined by y(k) = x*. Note 
that this map is already well defined since there is no ambiguity in the representation 
of elements in the domain. Since (by Proposition 2) x? 4 x”, for all distinct a, b € Z, 
y is injective. By definition of a cyclic group, ¢ is surjective. As above, the laws of 
exponents ensure g is a homomorphism, hence ¢ is an isomorphism, completing the 
proof. 
We chose to use the rotation group (r ) as our prototypical example of a finite cyclic 
group of order n (instead of the isomorphic group Z/nZ) since we shall usually write 
our cyclic groups multiplicatively: 
Notation: For each n € Z*, let Z,, be the cyclic group of order n (written multiplica- 
tively). 
Up to isomorphism, Z,, is the unique cyclic group of order n and Z, = Z/nZ. On 
occasion when we find additive notation advantageous we shall use the latter group as 
56 Chap.2 Subgroups
our representative of the isomorphism class of cyclic groups of order n. We shall occa- 
sionally say “let (x ) be the infinite cyclic group” (written multiplicatively), however 
we shall always use Z (additively) to represent the infinite cyclic group. 
As noted earlier, a given cyclic group may have more than one generator. The next 
two propositions determine precisely which powers of x generate the group (x ). 
Proposition 5. Let G be a group, let x € G and leta € Z — {O}. 
(1) If |x| = ©, then |x7| = co. 
(2) If |x| =n < oo, then |[x*| = 
(n, a) 
(3) In particular, if |x| = n < oo and a is a positive integer dividing n, then 
jx“| = -. a 
Proof: (1) By way of contradiction assume |x| = oo but |x°7| = m < co. By 
definition of order 
l — (x°)" — xt” 
Also, 
yam (xa)! _ 17! — |. 
Now one of am or —am is positive (since neither a nor m is 0) so some positive power of 
x is the identity. This contradicts the hypothesis |x| = 00, so the assumption |x“| < oo 
must be false, that 1s, (1) holds. 
(2) Under the notation of (2) let 
y=x", (n,a)=d andwrite n=db, a=dc, 
for suitable b, c € Z with b > O. Since d 1s the greatest common divisor of n and a, 
the integers b and c are relatively prime: 
(b,c) = 1. 
To establish (2) we must show | y| = b. First note that 
yo = x0 = xdeb — (x dbye = ye") = 1 =] 
so, by Proposition 3 applied to { y ), we see that | y| divides b. Let k = |y|. Then 
zak — yk 
so by Proposition 3 applied to (x), n | ak, 1.e., db | dck. Thus b | ck. Since b andc 
have no factors in common, b must divide k. Since b and k are positive integers which 
divide each other, b = k, which proves (2). 
(3) This 1s a special case of (2) recorded for future reference. 
Proposition 6. Let H = (x). 
(1) Assume |x| = oo. Then H = (x7 ) if and only ifa = +1. 
(2) Assume |x| =n < oo. Then H = (x° ) if and only if (a, n) = 1. In particular, 
the number of generators of H is y(n) (where ¢ is Euler’s g-function). 
Sec. 2.3 Cyclic Groups and Cyclic Subgroups 57
Proof: We leave (1) as an exercise. In (2) if |x| = n < ov, Proposition 2 says x* 
generates a subgroup of H of order |x*|. This subgroup equals all of H if and only if 
\x*| = |x|. By Proposition 5, 
|x?| = |x| if and only if n, 1.¢e. if and only if (a, n) = 1. (an) 
Since y(n) is, by definition, the number ofa ¢€ {1, 2,...,n} such that (a,n) = 1, this 
is the number of generators of H. 
Example 
Proposition 6 tells precisely which residue classes mod n generate Z/nZ: namely, a gen- 
erates Z/nZ if and only if (a,n) = 1. For instance, 1, 5, 7 and 11 are the generators of 
Z/12Z and p(12) = 4. 
The final theorem in this section gives the complete subgroup structure of a cyclic 
group. 
Theorem 7. Let H = (x) be acyclic group. 
(1) Every subgroup of H is cyclic. More precisely, if K < H, then either K = {1} 
or K = (x7), where d is the smallest positive integer such that x7 € K. 
(2) If |H| = ov, then for any distinct nonnegative integers a and b, (x°) £ 
(x). Furthermore, for every integer m, (x”) = (x!"!), where |m| denotes 
the absolute value of m, so that the nontrivial subgroups of H correspond 
bijectively with the integers 1, 2,3,.... 
(3) If |H| =n < ox, then for each positive integer a dividing n there is a unique 
n 
subgroup of H of ordera. This subgroup is the cyclic group (x? ), whered = —. 
a 
Furthermore, for every integer m, (x) = (x”™ ), so that the subgroups of 
H correspond bijectively with the positive divisors of n. 
Proof: (1) Let K < H.If K = {1}, the proposition is true for this subgroup, so we 
assume K + {1}. Thus there exists some a ~ 0 such that x° € K. If a < O then since 
K is a group also x~? = (x*)~! € K. Hence K always contains some positive power 
of x. Let 
P={b|beZ* and x’ € K}. 
By the above, ? is a nonempty set of positive integers. By the Well Ordering Principle 
(Section 0.2) P has a minimum element — call it d. Since K is asubgroup and x4 € K, 
(x7) < K. Since K isa subgroup of H, any element of K is of the form x“ for some 
integer a. By the Division Algorithm write 
a=qd+r O<r<d. 
Then x” = x©@-9 = x%(x7)—4 isanelement of K since both x? and x? are elements of 
K. By the minimality of d it follows thatr = 0,i.e.,a = gd andso x? = (x7)? € (x7). 
This gives the reverse containment K < (x“) which proves (1). 
We leave the proof of (2) as an exercise (the reasoning is similar to and easier than 
the proof of (3) which follows). 
58 Chap.2 Subgroups
(3) Assume |H| = n < o6 anda | n. Letd = " and apply Proposition 5(3) to 
a 
obtain that (x ) is a subgroup of order a, showing the existence of a subgroup of order 
a. To show uniqueness, suppose K is any subgroup of H of order a. By part (1) we 
have 
K = (x°) 
where b is the smallest positive integer such that x? € K. By Proposition 5 
so d = (n, b). In particular, d | b. Since b is a multiple of d, x? € (x4), hence 
K = (x?) < (x°). 
Since |(x7)| =a = |K|, we have K = (x7). 
The final assertion of (3) follows from the observation that ( x” ) is a subgroup of 
(x®™ ) (check this) and, it follows from Proposition 5(2) and Proposition 2 that they 
have the same order. Since (n, m) 1s certainly a divisor of n, this shows that every 
subgroup of H arises from a divisor of n, completing the proof. 
Examples 
(1) We can use Proposition 6 and Theorem 7 to list all the subgroups of Z/nZ for any 
given n. For example, the subgroups of Z/12Z are 
(a) Z/12Z = (1) = (5) = (7) = (11) (order 12) 
(b) (2) = (10) (order 6) 
(c) (3) = (9) (order 4) 
(d) (4) = (8) (order 3) 
(e) (6) (order 2) 
(f) (0) (order 1). 
The inclusions between them are given by 
(a) <(b) if and only if (6, 12) | (2,12), 1<a,b< 12. 
(2) We can also combine the results of this section with those of the preceding one. For 
example, we can obtain subgroups of a group G by forming Cg({ x )) and NG((x )), 
for each x € G. One can check that an element g in G commutes with x if and only 
if g commutes with all powers of x, hence 
Co((x )) = Cg). 
As noted in Exercise 6, Section 2, (x) < NG({x)) but equality need not hold. For 
instance, if G = Qg and x =i, 
Co(i)) = {41,41} = (i) and Ne((i)) = Qe. 
Note that we already observed the first of the above two equalities and the second is 
most easily computed using the result of Exercise 24 following.

2.4 SUBGROUPS GENERATED BY SUBSETS OF A GROUP 
The method of forming cyclic subgroups of a given group 1s a special case of the general 
technique where one forms the subgroup generated by an arbitrary subset of a group. In 
the case of cyclic subgroups one takes a singleton subset {x} of the group G and forms 
all integral powers of x, which amounts to closing the set {x} under the group operation 
and the process of taking inverses. The resulting subgroup is the smallest subgroup of 
G which contains the set {x} (smallest in the sense that if H is any subgroup which 
contains {x}, then H contains (x )). Another way of saying this 1s that ( x ) is the unique 
minimal element of the set of subgroups of G containing x (ordered under inclusion). 
In this section we investigate analogues of this when {x} is replaced by an arbitrary 
subset of G. 
Throughout mathematics the following theme recurs: given an object G (such as 
a group, field, vector space, etc.) and a subset A of G, 1s there a unique minimal 
subobject of G (subgroup, subfield, subspace, etc.) which contains A and, if so, how 
are the elements of this subobject computed? Students may already have encountered 
this question in the study of vector spaces. When G is a vector space (with, say, real 
number scalars) and A = {v1, v2,...,U,}, then there is a unique smallest subspace of 
Sec. 2.4 Subgroups Generated by Subsets of a Group 61
G which contains A, namely the (linear) span of v1, v2, ..., v, and each vector in this 
span can be written as kv, + k2v2 +---+k,vUn, for some ki, ...,k, € R. When A is 
a single nonzero vector, v, the span of {v} is simply the 1-dimensional subspace or line 
containing v and every element of this subspace is of the form kv forsome k € R. This 
is the analogue in the theory of vector spaces of cyclic subgroups of a group. Note that 
the 1-dimensional subspaces contain kv, where k € R, not just kv, where k € Z; the 
reason being that a subspace must be closed under all the vector space operations (e.g., 
scalar multiplication) not just the group operation of vector addition. 
Let G be any group and let A be any subset of G. We now make precise the notion 
of the subgroup of G generated by A. We prove that because the intersection of any set 
of subgroups of G is also a subgroup of G, the subgroup generated by A is the unique 
smallest subgroup of G containing A; it is “ smallest” in the sense of being the minimal 
element of the set of all subgroups containing A. We show that the elements of this 
subgroup are obtained by closing the given subset under the group operation (and taking 
inverses). In succeeding parts of the text when we develop the theory of other algebraic 
objects we shall refer to this section as the paradigm in proving that a given subset 
is contained in a unique smallest subobject and that the elements of this subobject are 
obtained by closing the subset under the operations which define the object. Since in the 
latter chapters the details will be omitted, students should acquire a solid understanding 
of the process at this point. 
In order to proceed we need only the following. 
Proposition 8. If Ais any nonempty collection of subgroups of G, then the intersection 
of all members of A is also a subgroup of G. 
Proof: This is an easy application of the subgroup criterion (see also Exercise 10, 
Section 1). Let 
K=()H. 
HeA 
Since each H € Ais a subgroup, 1 € H,sol € K, thatis, K #4 @. Ifa,be K, 
then a,b € H, for all H € A. Since each H is a group, ab™! € H, for all H, hence 
ab € K. Proposition 1 gives that K < G. 
Definition. If A is any subset of the group G define 
(A)=()H. 
ACH 
H<G 
This is called the subgroup of G generated by A. 
Thus ( A) is the intersection of all subgroups of G containing A. It is a subgroup 
of G by Proposition 8 applied to the set A = {H < G| A C H} (Ais nonempty since 
G € A). Since A lies ineach H € A, Aisa subset of their intersection, (A ). Note that 
(A) is the unique minimal element of A as follows: ( A ) is a subgroup of G containing 
A, so (A) € A; and any element of A contains the intersection of all elements in A, 
1.e., contains ( A ). 
62 Chap.2 Subgroups
When A is the finite set {a;,a2,...,4,} we write (a), a2,...,4a,) for the group 
generated by a), a2, ..., 4d, instead of { {a), dz, ...,a,}). If A and B are two subsets 
of G we shall write (A, B) in place of (AUB). 
This “top down” approach to defining { A ) proves existence and uniqueness of the 
smallest subgroup of G containing A but 1s not too enlightening as to how to construct 
the elements in it. As the word “generates” suggests we now define the set which is the 
closure of A under the group operation (and the process of taking inverses) and prove 
this set equals {A ). Let 
A= {a;'ay...a" |n eZ, n> Oanda; € A, €; = £1 for each i} 
where A = {1} if A = @, so that A is the set of all finite products (called words) of 
elements of A and inverses of elements of A. Note that the a;’s need not be distinct, 
so a’ is written aa in the notation defining A. Note also that A is not assumed to be a 
finite (or even countable) set. 
Proposition 9. A = (A). 
Proof: We first prove A is a subgroup. Note that A # @ (even if A = @). If 
a,b € Awitha = af'a? ...a‘ and b = b)'b? ... b’, then 
-l_ 7a, En —Om, —8rn—1 —5; ab" =a;'a,...a,"-b "by... by 
(where we used Exercise 15 of Section 1.1 to compute b~'). Thus ab™! is a product 
of elements of A raised to powers +1, hence ab~! € A. Proposition 1 implies A is a 
subgroup of G. 
Since each a € A may be written a!, it follows that A C A, hence (A) C A. But 
(A) is a group containing A and, since it 1s closed under the group operation and the 
process of taking inverses, { A) contains each element of the form aj'a;’ ... a‘, that 
is, AC (A). This completes the proof of the proposition. 
We now use (A) in place of A and may take the definition of A as an equivalent 
definition of { A). As noted above, in this equivalent definition of ( A ), products of the 
forma-a,a-a-a,a-a—', etc. could have been simplified to a”, a>, 1, etc. respectively, 
so another way of writing {A ) Is 
(A) = {ay'a;’...a%" | foreachi, a; € A,a; € Z,a; #a;4,; andn € Z*}. 
In fact, when A = {x} this was our definition of (A). 
If G is abelian, we could commute the a;’s and so collect all powers of a given 
generator together. For instance, 1f A were the finite subset {a),a2,...,a;} of the 
abelian group G, one easily checks that 
(A) = {a;'a;’ ...a,* | a; € Z for each i}. 
If in this situation we further assume that each a; has finite order d;, for all 1, then 
since there are exactly d; distinct powers of a;, the total number of distinct products of 
the form a}'a,’ ...a," is at most dd. . . dy, that is, 
|(A)| S didz...dk. 
Sec. 2.4 Subgroups Generated by Subsets of a Group 63
It may happen that a%b® = a” b® even though a® # aY and b? ¢ b*. We shall explore 
exactly when this happens when we study direct products in Chapter 5. 
When G is non-abelian the situation is much more complicated. For example, let 
G = Dgandletr ands be the usual generators of Dg (note thatthe notation Dg = (r, s) 
is consistent with the notation introduced in Section 1.2). Let a = s, let b = rs and 
let A = {a, b}. Since both s andr (= rs - s) belong to (a,b), G = (a,b), 10., G 1s 
also generated by a and b. Both a and b have order 2, however Dg has order 8. This 
means that it is not possible to write every element of Dg in the form a%b*, a, B € Z. 
More specifically, the product aba cannot be simplified to a product of the form a%b*. 
In fact, if G = D2, for anyn > 2, and r, s, a, b are defined in the same way as above, 
it is still true that 
la] =|b}=2, Dan=(a,b) and |D2,| = 2n. 
This means that for large n, long products of the form abab...ab cannot be further 
simplified. In particular, this illustrates that, unlike the abelian (or, better yet, cyclic) 
group case, the order of a (finite) group cannot even be bounded once we know the 
orders of the elements in some generating set. 
Another example of this phenomenon is S,: 
S, = ((12),(123..-n)). 
Thus S,, is generated by an element of order 2 together with one of order n, yet |S,,| =n! 
(we shall prove these statements later after developing some more techniques). 
One final example emphasizes the fact that if G is non-abelian, subgroups of G 
generated by more than one element of G may be quite complicated. Let 
0 1 0 2 
1/2 0 
0 2 
(a, b) 1s an infinite subgroup of GL (IR) which is generated by two elements of order 
2. so a” = b? = 1 butab = . It is easy to see that ab has infinite order, so 
These examples illustrate that when |A| > 2 itis difficult, in general, to compute 
even the order of the subgroup generated by A, let alone any other structural properties. 
It is therefore impractical to gather much information about subgroups of a non-abelian 
group created by taking random subsets A and trying to write out the elements of (or 
other information about) (A). For certain “well chosen” subsets A, even of a non- 
abelian group G, we shall be able to make both theoretical and computational use of 
the subgroup generated by A. One example of this might be when we want to find 
a subgroup of G which contains (x) properly; we might search for some element y 
which commutes with x (1e., y € Cg(x)) and form (x, y). It is easy to check that 
the latter group is abelian, so its order is bounded by |x||y|. Alternatively, we might 
instead take y in NG(( x )) — 1m this case the same order bound holds and the structure 
of (x, y) is again not too complicated (as we shall see in the next chapter). 
The complications which arise for non-abelian groups are generally not quite as 
serious when we study other basic algebraic systems because of the additional algebraic 
structure imposed.

2.5 THE LATTICE OF SUBGROUPS OF A GROUP 
In this section we describe a graph associated with a group which depicts the relation- 
ships among its subgroups. This graph, called the lattice? of subgroups of the group, is 
a good way of “visualizing” a group — it certainly illuminates the structure of a group 
better than the group table. We shall be using lattice diagrams, or parts of them, to 
describe both specific groups and certain properties of general groups throughout the 
chapters on group theory. Moreover, the lattice of subgroups of a group will play an 
important role in Galois Theory. 
The lattice of subgroups of a given finite group G is constructed as follows: plot 
all subgroups of G starting at the bottom with 1, ending at the top with G and, roughly 
speaking, with subgroups of larger order positioned higher on the page than those of 
smaller order. Draw paths upwards between subgroups using the rule that there will 
be a line upward from A to B if A < B and there are no subgroups properly between 
A and B. Thus if A < B there 1s a path (possibly many paths) upward from A to B 
passing through a chain of intermediate subgroups (and a path downward from B to 
A if B > A). The initial positioning of the subgroups on the page, which 1s, a priori, 
somewhat arbitrary, can often (with practice) be chosen to produce a simple picture. 
Notice that for any pair of subgroups H and K of G the unique smallest subgroup 
2The term “lattice” has a precise mathematical meaning in terms of partially ordered sets. 
66 Chap.2 Subgroups
which contains both of them, namely ( H, K ) (called the join of H and K), may be 
read off from the lattice as follows: trace paths upwards from H and K until acommon 
subgroup A which contains H and K is reached (note that G itself always contains all 
subgroups so at least one such A exists). To ensure that A = ( H, K ) make sure there is 
no A; < A (indicated by a downward path from A to A) with both H and K contained 
in A, (otherwise replace A with A, and repeat the process to see if Ay = ( H, K )). By 
a symmetric process one can read off the largest subgroup of G which is contained in 
both H and K, namely their intersection (which 1s a subgroup by Proposition 8). 
There are some limitations to this process, in particular it cannot be carried out per 
se for infinite groups. Even for finite groups of relatively small order, lattices can be 
quite complicated (see the book Groups of Order 2",n < 6 by M. Hall and J. Senior, 
Macmillan, 1964, for some hair-raising examples). At the end of this section we shall 
describe how parts of a lattice may be drawn and used even for infinite groups. 
Note that isomorphic groups have the same lattices (1.e., the same directed graphs). 
Nonisomorphic groups may also have identical lattices (this happens for two groups of 
order 16 — see the following exercises). Since the lattice of subgroups 1s only part of 
the data we shall carry in our descriptors of a group, this will not be a serious drawback 
(indeed, 1t might even be useful in seeing when two nonisomorphic groups have some 
common properties). 
Examples 
Except for the cyclic groups (Example 1) we have not proved that the following lattices 
are Correct (e.g., contain all subgroups of the given group or have the right joins and 
intersections). For the moment we shall take these facts as given and, as we build up more 
theory in the course of the text, we shall assign as exercises the proofs that these are indeed 
correct. 
(1) For G = Z, = Z/nZ, by Theorem 7 the lattice of subgroups of G is the lattice of 
divisors of n (that is, the divisors of m are written on a page with n at the bottom, 1 at 
the top and paths upwards from a to b if b | a). Some specific examples for various 
values of n follow.

In many instances in both theoretical proofs and specific examples we shall be 
interested only in information concerning two (or some small number of) subgroups of 
a given group and their interrelationships. To depict these graphically we shall draw a 
sublattice of the entire group lattice which contains the relevant joins and intersections. 
An unbroken line in such a sublattice will not, 1n general, mean that there is no subgroup 
in between the endpoints of the line. These partial lattices for groups will also be used 
when we are dealing with infinite groups. For example, if we wished to discuss only 
the relationship between the subgroups (sr7, r+) and (r? ) of Dig we would draw the 
sublattice

70 Chap.2 Subgroups
Note that (s, r?) and (r*) are precisely the join and intersection, respectively, of these 
two subgroups in Dj¢. 
Finally, given the lattice of subgroups of a group, it is relatively easy to compute 
normalizers and centralizers. For example, in Dg we can see that Cp, (s) = (s, r? ) be- 
cause we first calculate that r? € C p,(S) (see Section 2). This proves ( s, r-)<C D,(S) 
(note that an element always belongs to its own centralizer). The only subgroups which 
contain (s,r?) are that subgroup itself and allof Dg. We cannot have Cp,(s) = Ds 
because r does not commute with s (i.e., r ¢ Cp,(s)). This leaves only the claimed 
possibility for Cp, (s).

CHAPTER 3 
Quotient Groups and 
Homomorphisms 
3.1 DEFINITIONS AND EXAMPLES 
In this chapter we introduce the notion of a quotient group of a group G, which 1s 
another way of obtaining a “smaller” group from the group G and, as we did with 
subgroups, we shall use quotient groups to study the structure of G. The structure of 
the group G 1s reflected in the structure of the quotient groups and the subgroups of G. 
For example, we shall see that the lattice of subgroups for a quotient of G 1s reflected 
at the “top” (in a precise sense) of the lattice for G whereas the lattice for a subgroup 
of G occurs naturally at the “bottom.” One can therefore obtain information about the 
group G by combining this information and we shall indicate how some classification 
theorems arise in this way. 
The study of the quotient groups of G is essentially equivalent to the study of the 
homomorphisms of G, 1.e., the maps of the group G to another group which respect 
the group structures. If g is a homomorphism from G to a group H recall that the 
fibers of ¢ are the sets of elements of G projecting to single elements of H, which we 
can represent pictorially in Figure 1, where the vertical line in the box above a point a 
represents the fiber of g over a. 
oe ° —" H Fig. 1 
73
The group operation in H provides a way to multiply two elements in the image 
of ¢@ (1.e., two elements on the horizontal! line in Figure 1). This suggests a natural 
multiplication of the fibers lying above these two points making the set of fibers into 
a group: if Xz, 1s the fiber above a and X; is the fiber above b then the product of X, 
with X; is defined to be the fiber Xz, above the product ab, 1.e., X,X, = Xap. This 
multiplication is associative since multiplication is associative in H, the identity is the 
fiber over the identity of H, and the inverse of the fiber over a is the fiber over am, 
as 1s easily checked from the definition. For example, the associativity is proved as 
follows: (X~X4)Xc = (Xab)Xc = Xabyc and Xqg(XpX_—-) = Xa(Xoc) = Xa). Since 
(ab)c = a(bc) in H, (XgXp)Xc = Xq(XpX-). Roughly speaking, the group G is 
partitioned into pieces (the fibers) and these pieces themselves have the structure of a 
group, called a quotient group of G (a formal definition follows the example below). 
Since the multiplication of fibers is defined from the multiplication in H, by con- 
struction the quotient group with this multiplication is naturally isomorphic to the image 
of G under the homomorphism ¢ (fiber X, 1s identified with its image a in A). 
Example 
Let G =Z, let H = Z,, = (x) be the cyclic group of order n and define g : Z > Z,, by 
g(a) = x*. Since 
g(a +b) =x*t? = x*x? = o(a)g(b) 
it follows that g is a homomorphism (note that the operation in Z is addition and the 
operation in Z,, is multiplication). Note also that g is surjective. The fiber of g over x° is 
then 
go 'a%) ={(meZ|x™ =x} =(meZ|x"™47=1) 
= {me Z|n divides m — a} (by Proposition 2.3) 
={meZ|m=a (mod n)} =a, 
1.e., the fibers of g are precisely the residue classes modulo n. Figure 1 here becomes:

The multiplication in Z,, is just x7 x? = xt The corresponding fibers are a, b, anda + b, 
so the corresponding group operation for the fibers is @ - b = a + b. This is just the group 
Z[nZ under addition, a group isomorphic to the image of ¢ (all of Z,,). 
The identity of this group (the fiber above the identity 1n Z,,) consists of all the multiples 
of n in Z, namely nZ, a subgroup of Z, and the remaining fibers are just translates, a + nZ, 
ofthis subgroup. The group operation canalso be defined directly by taking representatives 
from these fibers, adding these representatives in Z and taking the fiber containing this sum 
(this was the original definition of the group Z/nZ). From a computational point of view 
computing the product of @ and b by simply adding representatives a and b is much easier 
than first computing the image of these fibers under gy (namely, x@ and x”), multiplying 
these in H (obtaining x?+?) and then taking the fiber over this product. 
We first consider some basic properties of homomorphisms and their fibers. The 
fiber of ahomomorphism ¢ : G — H lying above the identity of H 1s given a name: 
Definition. If g is ahomomorphism g : G — H, the kernel of ¢ is the set 
{g €G| ¢(g) = I} 
and will be denoted by ker ¢ (here 1 1s the identity of 77). 
Proposition 1. Let G and H be groups and let g : G — H be a homomorphism. 
(1) g(1g) = 14, where 1g and 1y are the identities of G and H, respectively. 
(2) o(g~!) = v(g)" for all g € G. 
(3) y(2") = 9(g)" for all n € Z. 
(4) kerg is a subgroup of G. 
(5) im (@), the image of G under g, 1s a subgroup of H. 
Proof: (1) Since gg) = g¢UcGglg) = ¢Ucg)¢Uc), the cancellation laws show 
that (1) holds. 
(2) 91g) = 9(gg~") = o(g)y(g7") and, by part (1), ¢(1¢) = In, hence 
ln = 9(8)9(g *). 
Multiplying both sides on the left by y(g)~! and simplifying gives (2). 
(3) This is an easy exercise in induction for n € Z*. By part (2), conclusion (3) 
holds for negative values of n as well. 
(4) Since 1g € kerg, the kernel of ¢g is not empty. Let x, y € kerg, that is 
g(x) = 9(y) = lx. Then 
gay!) = ge = 9) 90)! = 1417 = 1h 
that is, xy~! € kerg. By the subgroup criterion, ker g < G. 
(5) Since g(1g) = 1x, the identity of H lies in the image of ¢, s oim(¢) is nonempty. 
If x and y are in im(¢), say x = g(a), y = g(b), then y-! = g(b~!) by (2) so that 
xy~! = g(a)y(b“) = ¢g(ab“") since g is a homomorphism. Hence also xy! is in 
the image of gy, so im(¢) is a subgroup of H by the subgroup criterion. 
We can now define some terminology associated with quotient groups. 
Sec. 3.1. Definitions and Examples 75
Definition. Let g: G — H bea homomorphism with kernel K. The quotient group 
or factor group, G/K (read G modulo K or simply G mod K), is the group whose 
elements are the fibers of g with group operation defined above: namely if X is the 
fiber above a and Y is the fiber above b then the product of X with Y is defined to be 
the fiber above the product ab. 
The notation emphasizes the fact that the kernel K is a single element in the group 
G/K and we shall see below (Proposition 2) that, as in the case of Z/nZ above, the 
other elements of G/K are just the “translates” of the kernel K. Hence we may think 
of G/K as being obtained by collapsing or “dividing out” by K (or more precisely, by 
equivalence modulo K). This explains why G/K is referred to as a “quotient” group. 
The definition of the quotient group G/K above requires the map ¢ explicitly, 
since the multiplication of the fibers is performed by first projecting the fibers to H 
via g, multiplying in H and then determining the fiber over this product. Just as for 
Z/nZ above, it is also possible to define the multiplication of fibers directly in terms 
of representatives from the fibers. This is computationally simpler and the map ¢ does 
not enter explicitly. We first show that the fibers of a homomorphism can be expressed 
in terms of the kernel of the homomorphism just as in the example above (where the 
kernel was nZ and the fibers were translates of the form a + nZ). 
Proposition 2. Let g : G — H be a homomorphism of groups with kernel K. Let 
X € G/K be the fiber above a, i.e., X = g~!(a). Then 
(@) Foranyue X, X={uk|k eK} 
(2) Foranyue X, X = {ku |ke K}. 
Proof: We prove (1) and leave the proof of (2) as an exercise. Let u € X so, by 
definition of X, g(u) = a. Let 
uK = {uk |k € K}. 
We first prove uK C X. Foranyk e€ K, 
g(uk) = g(u)g(k) (since g is a homomorphism) 
= g(u)1 (since k € ker g) 
=a, 
that is, uk € X. This proves uK C X. To establish the reverse inclusion suppose 
g © X and letk = u-'g. Then 
o(k) = o(u")g(g) = gu) '¢(g) (by Proposition 1) 
1 =a a=1. 
Thus k € kergy. Since k = u~!g, g = uk € uK, establishing the inclusion X C uK. 
This proves (1). 
The sets arising in Proposition 2 to describe the fibers of a homomorphism ¢ are 
defined for any subgroup K of G, not necessarily the kernel of some homomorphism 
(we shall determine necessary and sufficient conditions for a subgroup to be such a 
Kernel shortly) and are given a name: 
76 Chap.3 Quotient Groups and Homomorphisms
Definition. For any N < G and any g € G let 
gN={gn|neN} and Ng={ng|neN} 
called respectively a left coset and a right coset of N in G. Any element of a coset is 
called a representative for the coset. 
We have already seen in Proposition 2 that if N is the kernel of a homomorphism 
and g; is any representative for the coset gN then giN = gWN (and if g, € Ng then 
Ng, = Ng). Weshall see that this fact is valid for arbitrary subgroups N in Proposition 
4 below, which explains the terminology of a representative. 
If G is an additive group we shall write g + N and N + g for the left and right 
cosets of N in G with representative g, respectively. In general we can think of the left 
coset, g N, of N in G as the left translate of N by g. (The reader may wish to review 
Exercise 18 of Section 1.7 which proves that the right cosets of N in G are precisely 
the orbits of N acting on G by left multiplication.) 
In terms of this definition, Proposition 2 shows that the fibers of a homomorphism 
are the left cosets of the kernel (and also the right cosets of the kernel), i.e., the elements 
of the quotient G/K are the left cosets gK, g € G. Inthe example of Z/nZ the 
multiplication in the quotient group could also be defined in terms of representatives 
for the cosets. The following result shows the same result is true for G/K in general 
(provided we know that K is the kernel of some homomorphism), namely that the 
product of two left cosets X and Y in G/K is computed by choosing any representative 
u of X, any representative v of Y, multiplying u and v in G and forming the coset 
(uv) K. 
Theorem 3. Let G be a group and let K be the kernel of some homomorphism from 
G to another group. Then the set whose elements are the left cosets of K in G with 
operation defined by 
uK ovK = (uv)K 
forms a group, G/K. Inparticular, this operation is well defined in the sense thatif uv; is 
any element in uv K and v; is any element in vK, then u,v; € uvK,1.e., u4j4u;K = uvK 
so that the multiplication does not depend on the choice of representatives for the cosets. 
The same statement is true with “right coset” in place of “left coset.” 
Proof: Let X, Y € G/K andlet Z = XY in G/K, so that by Proposition 2(1) X, 
Y and Z are (left) cosets of K. By assumption, K is the kernel of some homomorphism 
g:G—> HsoX = g(a) and Y = g !(b) for some a, b € H. By definition of 
the operation in G/K, Z = g '(ab). Let u and v be arbitrary representatives of X, 
Y, respectively, so that g(u) = a, g(v) = band X = uK, Y = vK. We must show 
uv € Z. Now 
uvEeZ & uve gy '(ab) 
= g(uv) =ab 
= g(u)g(v) = ab. 
Sec. 3.1 Definitions and Examples 77
Since the latter equality does hold, uv € Z hence Z 1s the (left) coset uu K. (Exercise 
2 below shows conversely that every z € Z can be written as uv, forsomeu € X and 
v € Y.) This proves that the product of X with Y is the coset uuK for any choice 
of representatives u € X, v € Y completing the proof of the first statements of the 
theorem. The last statement in the theorem follows immediately since, by Proposition 
2,uK = Ku andvK = Kv forall u andvinG. 
Interms of Figure 1, the multiplicationin G/K via representatives can be pictured 
as in the following Figure 3.

Fig. 3 
We emphasize the fact that the multiplication is independent of the particular rep- 
resentatives chosen. Namely, the product (or sum, if the group is written additively) of 
two cosets X and Y is the coset uvK containing the product uv where u and v are any 
representatives for the cosets X and Y, respectively. This process of considering only 
the coset containing an element, or “reducing mod K’”’ 1s the same as what we have been 
doing, in particular, in Z/nZ. A useful notation for denoting the coset u K containing 
a representative u is uv. With this notation (which we introduced in the Preliminaries in 
dealing with Z/nZ), the quotient group G/K is denoted G and the product of elements 
u and v is simply the coset containing uv, 1.e., 7v. This notation also reinforces the fact 
that the cosets uK in G/K are elements uinG/K. 
Examples 
(1) The first example in this chapter of the homomorphism g from Z to Z,, has fibers the 
left (and also the right) cosets a + nZ of the kernel nZ. Theorem 3 proves that these 
cosets form a group under addition of representatives, namely Z/nZ, which explains 
the notation for this group. The group is naturally isomorphic to its image under g, so 
we recover the isomorphism Z/nZ = Z,, of Chapter 2. 
(2) If g : G > H is anisomorphism, then K = 1, the fibers of g are the singleton 
subsets of G andso G/1 = G. 
78 Chap.3 Quotient Groups and Homomorphisms
(3) Let G be any group, let H = 1 be the group of order | and define g : G > H by 
y(g) = 1, forall g € G. Itis immediate that g is ahomomorphism. This map 1s called 
the trivial homomorphism. Note that in this case ker g = G and G/G is a group with 
the single element, G, 1.e.,G/G = Z, = {1}. 
(4) Let G = R? (operation vector addition), let H = R (operation addition) and define 
gy : R* > R by g((x, y)) = x. Thus g is projection onto the x-axis. We show 9 is a 
homomorphism: 
PC (x1, yi) + 2, y2)) = PCO + x2, M + y2)) 
= x1 +x2 = (1, y1)) + OC 2, y2))- 
Now 
ker p = {(x, y) | (x, y)) = 0) 
= {(x, y) | x = 0} = the y-axis. 
Note that ker gy is indeed a subgroup of R? and that the fiber of g over a € R is the 
translate of the y-axis by a, 1.e., the line x = a. This is also the left (and the right) coset 
of the kernel with representative (a, 0) (or any other representative point projecting to 
a): 
(a, 0) = (a,0) + y-axis.

The group operation (written additively here) can be described either by using the map 
g: the sum of the line (x = a) and the line (x = b) 1s the line (x = a+b); or directly in 
terms of coset representatives: the sum of the vertical line containing the point (a, y}) 
and the vertical line containing the point (b, y2) 1s the vertical line containing the point 
(a+ b, y, + y2). Note in particular that the choice of representatives of these vertical 
lines is not important (1.e., the y-coordinates are not important). 
(5) (An example where the group G 1s non-abelian.) Let G = Qg and let H = V4 be the 
Klein 4-group (Section 2.5, Example 2). Define g : Qg — V4 by 
o(+1) = 1, y(£1) =a, o(+j) = 5, g(£k) =e. 
Sec. 3.1. Definitions and Examples 79
The check that g is a homomorphism is left as an exercise — relying on symmetry 
minimizes the work in showing ¢(xy) = ¢(x)¢(y) for all x and y in Qg. It is clear 
that ¢y is surjective and that ker g = {+1}. One might think of ¢ as an “absolute value” 
function on Qs so the fibers of g are the sets E = {+1}, A = {+71}, B = {+/} and 
C = {+k}, which are collapsed to 1, a, b, and c respectively in Qg/{+1) and these 
are the left (and also the right) cosets of ker gy (for example, A = i - ker g = {i, —i} = 
ker ¢ -1). 
By Theorem 3, if we are given a subgroup K of a group G which we know 1s the 
kernel of some homomorphism, we may define the quotient G/K without recourse to 
the homomorphism by the multiplication uKuK = uvK. This raises the question of 
whether it 1s possible to define the quotient group G/N similarly for any subgroup N 
of G. The answer is no in general since this multiplication 1s not in general well defined 
(cf. Proposition 5 later). In fact we shall see that it is possible to define the structure 
of a group on the cosets of N if and only if N 1s the kernel of some homomorphism 
(Proposition 7). We shall also give a criterion to determine when a subgroup WN 1s such 
a kernel — this is the notion of a normal subgroup and we shall consider non-normal 
subgroups in subsequent sections. 
We first show that the cosets of an arbitrary subgroup of G partition G (.e., their 
union is all of G and distinct cosets have trivial intersection). 
Proposition 4. Let N be any subgroup of the group G. The set of left cosets of N in G 
form a partition of G. Furthermore, for allu, v € G,uN = vN if and only if viueN 
and in particular, uN = vN if and only if u and v are representatives of the same coset. 
Proof: First of all note thatsince N is a subgroup of G, 1 € N. Thus g = g-1 € gN 
for all g € G, 1Le., 
G=\|Jen. 
26€G 
To show that distinct left cosets have empty intersection, suppose uN M uN + &. We 
show uN = vN. Letx euNNvN. Write 
x =un=vM, for some n,m € N. 
In the latter equality multiply both sides on the right by n—! to get 
u=umn b= vm}, where m, = mn—'eN. 
Now for any element ut of uN (t € N), 
ut = (um})t = v(mjt) € UN. 
This proves uN C vWN. By interchanging the roles of u and v one obtains similarly that 
uN C uN. Thus two cosets with nonempty intersection coincide. 
By the first part of the proposition, uN = vN if and only if wu € vN if and only 
if u = un, forsomen € N if and only if v-'u € N, as claimed. Finally, v € uN is 
equivalent to saying v is a representative for uN, hence uN = vWN if and only if u and 
uv are representatives for the same coset (namely the coset uN = vN). 
80 Chap. 3 Quotient Groups and Homomorphisms
Proposition 5. Let G be a group and let N be a subgroup of G. 
(1) The operation on the set of left cosets of N in G described by 
uN -vN = (uv)N 
is well defined if and only if gng—! € N forall g € G andalln € N. 
(2) If the above operation is well defined, then it makes the set of left cosets of N 
in G into a group. In particular the identity of this group is the coset 1N and 
the inverse of gN is the coset g—!N i.e., (gN)~! = g "IN. 
Proof: (1) Assume first that this operation is well defined, that is, for all u, v € G, 
ifu,u,; € uN and v, vy; € uN then uuN = uN. 
Let g be an arbitrary element of G and let n be an arbitrary element of N. Letting 
u = 1,4; =nandv = v, = g7! and applying the assumption above we deduce that 
lg'N=ng'N ice. gIN= ng 'N. 
Since 1 € N,ng~!-1 €ng—N. Thusng™! € g—'N, hence ng! = g~'ny, for some 
n, € N. Multiplying both sides on the left by g gives gng—'! = n, € N, as claimed. 
Conversely, assume gng! € N forall g € Gandalln € N. To prove the operation 
stated above is well defined let u, u; € uN and v, vy; € uN. We may write 
u,=unandv; =vum, forsomen,m EN. 
We must prove that u,v; € uvN: 
u,v, = (un)(vm) = u(vv—!)num 
= (uv)(v_'nv)m = (uv)(mm), 
where ny = v~'!nv = (v—')n(v~!)~! is an element of N by assumption. Now N is 
closed under products, so n;m € N. Thus 
U,V, = (uv)n2, for some nz € N. 
Thus the left cosets wuN and u,v;N contain the common element u;v;. By the pre- 
ceding proposition they are equal. This proves that the operation is well defined. 
(2) If the operation on cosets is well defined the group axioms are easy to check 
and are induced by their validity in G. For example, the associative law holds because 
for all u, v, w € G, 
(uN)(vuNwN) = uN(vwN) 
= u(vw)N 
= (uv)wN = (uNuvN)\(wN), 
since u(uw) = (uv)w in G. The identity in G/N is the coset 1N and the inverse of 
gN is g_'N as is immediate from the definition of the multiplication. 
As indicated before, the subgroups WN satisfying the condition in Proposition 5 for 
which there is a natural group structure on the quotient G/N are given a name: 
Sec. 3.1. Definitions and Examples 81
Definition. The element gng™! is called the conjugate of n € N by g. The set 
eNg! = {gng™! | n € N} is called the conjugate of N by g. The element g is 
said to normalize N if gNg~! = N. A subgroup N of a group G is called normal if 
every element of G normalizes N, i.e., if gVg~! = N forall g € G. If N is a normal 
subgroup of G we shall write N < G. 
Note that the structure of G is reflected in the structure of the quotient G/N when 
N is anormal subgroup (for example, the associativity of the multiplication in G/N is 
induced from the associativity in G and inverses in G/N are induced from inverses in 
G). We shall see more of the relationship of G to its quotient G/N when we consider 
the Isomorphism Theorems later in Section 3. 
We summarize our results above as Theorem 6. 
Theorem 6. Let N be a subgroup of the group G. The following are equivalent: 
@ NAG 
(2) Nc(N) = G (recall NG(N) is the normalizer in G of N) 
(3) gN=Ngforallg eG 
(4) the operation on left cosets of N in G described in Proposition 5 makes the set 
of left cosets into a group 
(5) gNg! CN forallg € G. 
Proof: We have already done the hard equivalences; the others are left as exercises. 
As apractical matter, one tries to minimize the computations necessary to determine 
whether a given subgroup N is normal in a group G. In particular, one tries to avoid as 
much as possible the computation of all the conjugates gng—! forn € N and g € G. For 
example, the elements of N itself normalize N since N is asubgroup. Also, if one has a 
set of generators for N, it suffices to check that all conjugates of these generators lie in 
N to prove that N is anormal subgroup (this is because the conjugate of a product is the 
product of the conjugates and the conjugate of the inverse is the inverse of the conjugate) 
— this is Exercise 26 later. Similarly, if generators for G are also known, then it suffices 
to check that these generators for G normalize N. In particular, if generators for both 
N and G are known, this reduces the calculations to a small number of conjugations 
to check. If N is a finite group then it suffices to check that the conjugates of a set 
of generators for N by a set of generators for G are again elements of N (Exercise 
29). Finally, it is often possible to prove directly that Ng(N) = G without excessive 
computations (some examples appear in the next section), again proving that N is a 
normal subgroup of G without mindlessly computing all possible conjugates gng™!. 
We now prove that the normal subgroups are precisely the same as the kernels of 
homomorphisms considered earlier. 
Proposition 7. A subgroup N of the group G is normal if and only if it is the kernel of 
some homomorphism. 
Proof: If N is the kernel of the homomorphism 9g, then Proposition 2 shows that 
the left cosets of N are the same as the right cosets of N (and both are the fibers of the 
82 Chap.3 Quotient Groups and Homomorphisms
map ¢). By (3) of Theorem 6, N is then a normal subgroup. (Another direct proof of 
this from the definition of normality for N is given in the exercises). 
Conversely, if N < G, let H = G/N anddefine z : G ~ G/N by 
m(g) = gN for all g € G. 
By definition of the operation in G/N, 
(8182) = (8182)N = 81Ng2.N = n(81)7 (82). 
This proves z isa homomorphism. Now 
kerz = {g €G|2(g) = 1N} 
={g €G|gN =1N} 
={geG|gEeNJ=N. 
Thus N is the kernel of the homomorphism zr. 
The homomorphism z constructed above demonstrating the normal subgroup N 
as the kernel of a homomorphism is given a name: 
Definition. Let N < G. The homomorphism z : G > G/N defined by z(g) = gN 
is called the natural projection (homomorphism)! of G onto G/N. If H < G/N isa 
subgroup of G/N, the complete preimage Of H in G is the preimage of H under the 
natural projection homomorphism. 
The complete preimage of a subgroup of G/N is a subgroup of G (cf. Exercise 1) 
which contains the subgroup WN since these are the elements which map to the identity 
1 € H. We shall see in the Isomorphism Theorems in Section 3 that there is a natural 
correspondence between the subgroups of G that contain N and the subgroups of the 
quotient G/N. 
We now have an “internal” criterion which determines precisely when a subgroup 
N of a given group G is the kernel of some homomorphism, namely, 
No(N) = G. 
We may thus think of the normalizer of a subgroup N of G as being a measure of 
“how close” N is to being a normal subgroup (this explains the choice of name for this 
subgroup). Keep in mind that the property of being normal is an embedding property, 
that is, it depends on the relation of N to G, not on the internal structure of N itself 
(the same group N may be anormal subgroup of G but not be normal in a larger group 
containing G). 
We began the discussion of quotient groups with the existence of a homomorphism 
gy of G to H and showed the kernel of this homomorphism is a normal subgroup N of 
G and the quotient G/N (defined in terms of fibers originally) is naturally isomorphic 
IThe word “natural” has a precise mathematical meaning in the theory of categories; for our 
purposes we use the term to indicate that the definition of this homomorphism is a “coordinate free” 
projection i.e., is described only in terms of the elements themselves, not in terms of generators for G 
or N (cf. Appendix II). 
Sec. 3.1. Definitions and Examples 83
to the image of G under g in H. Conversely, if N < G, we can find a group H 
(namely, G/N) and ahomomorphism z : G — H such that kerz = N (namely, 
the natural projection). The study of homomorphic images of G (1.e., the images of 
homomorphisms from G into other groups) is thus equivalent to the study of quotient 
groups of G and we shall use homomorphisms to produce normal subgroups and vice 
versa. 
We developed the theory of quotient groups by way of homomorphisms rather than 
simply defining the notion of a normal subgroup and its associated quotient group to 
emphasize the fact that the elements of the quotient are subsets (the fibers or cosets of the 
kernel NV) of the original group G. The visualization in Figure 1 also emphasizes that NV 
(and its cosets) are projected (or collapsed) onto single elements in the quotient G/N. 
Computations in the quotient group G/N are performed by taking representatives from 
the various cosets involved. 
Some examples of normal subgroups and their associated quotients follow. 
Examples 
Let G be a group. 
(1) The subgroups 1 and G are always normal in G; G/1 = G and G/G = 1. 
(2) If Gis an abelian group, any subgroup N of Gis normal because for all g € G and 
alln EN, 
1 1 eng =gg n=neNn. 
Note that it is important that G be abelian, not just that N be abelian. The structure of 
G/N may vary as we take different subgroups N of G. For instance, if G = Z, then 
every subgroup N of G is cyclic: 
N=(n)=(-n) =nZ, for some n € Z 
and G/N = Z/nZ is acyclic group with generator 1 = 1 + nZ (note that 1 is a 
generator for G). 
Suppose now that G = Z;, 1s the cyclic group of order k. Let x be a generator of 
G and let N < G. By Proposition 2.6 N = (x¢ ), where d is the smallest power of x 
which lies in N. Now 
G/N ={gN|g€ G} ={x°N|a€Z} 
and since x° N = (xN)* (see Exercise 4 below), it follows that 
G/N =(xN) 1.e., G/N 1s cyclic with x N as a generator. 
|G| By Exercise 5 below, the order of x N in G/N equals d. By Proposition 2.5, d = INT” 
In summary, 
quotient groups of acyclic group are cyclic 
and the image of a generator g for G is a generator g for the quotient. If in addition G 
1S a finite cyclic group and N < G, then |G/N| = IN| gives a formula for the order 
of the quotient group. 
(3) If N < Z(G), then N <I G because forall g € G andalln ce N, eng! =neNn, 
generalizing the previous example (where the center Z(G) is all of G). Thus, in 
particular, Z(G) < G. The subgroup ( —1 ) of Qg was previously seen to be the kernel 
of a homomorphism but since (—1) = Z(Qg) we obtain normality of this subgroup 
84 Chap.3 Quotient Groups and Homomorphisms
now in another fashion. We already saw that Qg/{—1) = V4. The discussion for 
Dg in the next paragraph could be applied equally well to Qg to give an independent 
identification of the isomorphism type of the quotient. 
Let G = Dg and let Z = (r*) = Z(Dg). Since Z = {1,r), each coset, gZ, 
consists of the two element set {g, gr”}. Since these cosets partition the 8 elements of 
Dg into pairs, there must be 4 (disjoint) left cosets of Z in Dg: 
1=1Z, r=rZ, S=sZ, and Fs=rsZ. 
Now by the classification of groups of order 4 (Exercise 10, Section 2.5) we know that 
Dg/Z(Dg) = Z4 or V4. To determine which of these two 1s correct (1.e., determine 
the isomorphism type of the quotient) simply observe that 
(7)? =r*Z=1Z=1 
(5)? =s*Z=1Z=1 
(rs)? = (rs)*Z=1Z=1 
so every nonidentity element in Dg/Z has order 2. In particular there is no element 
of order 4 in the quotient, hence Dg/Z is not cyclic so Dg/Z(Dg) = V4.
