Probability 
An Introduction with 
Applications in Data Science 
Roman Vershymn 
“This is an excellent and very timely text,presenting the modern tools of high-dimensional 
geometry and probability in a very accessible and applications-oriented manner,with plenty 
of informative exercises.The book is infused with the author’s insights and intuition in 
this field,and has extensive references to the latest developments in the area.It will be an 
extremely useful resource both for newcomers to this subject and for expert researchers.”
—Terence Tao,University of California,Los Angeles 
“Methods of high-dimensional probability have become indispensable in numerous prob-
lems of probability theory and its applications in mathematics,statistics,computer science,
and electrical engineering.Roman Vershynin’s wonderful text fills a major gap in the litera-
ture by providing a highly accessible introduction to this area.Starting with no prerequisites 
beyond a first course in probability and linear algebra,Vershynin takes the reader on a guided 
tour through the subject and consistently illustrates the utility of the material through modern 
data science applications.This book should be essential reading for students and researchers 
in probability theory,data science,and related fields.”
—Ramon van Handel,Princeton University 
“This very welcome contribution to the literature gives a concise introduction to several 
topics in ‘high-dimensional probability’that are of key relevance in contemporary statistical 
science and machine learning.The author achieves a fine balance between presenting deep 
theory and maintaining readability for a non-specialist audience —this book is thus highly 
recommended for graduate students and researchers alike who wish to learn more about this 
by-now-indispensable field of modern mathematics.”
—Richard Nickl,University of Cambridge 
“Vershynin is one of the world’s leading experts in the area of high-dimensional probability,
and his textbook provides a gentle yet thorough treatment of many of the key tools in the 
area and their applications to the field of data science.The topics covered here are a must-
know for anyone looking to do mathematical work in the field,covering subjects important 
in machine learning,algorithms and theoretical computer science,signal processing,and 
applied mathematics.”
—Jelani Nelson,Harvard University 
“High-Dimensional Probability is an excellent treatment of modern methods in probability 
and data analysis.Vershynin’s perspective is unique and insightful,informed by his expertise 
as both a probabulist and a functional analyst.His treatment of the subject is gentle,thorough,
and inviting,providing a great resource for both newcomers and those familiar with the 
subject.I believe,as the author does,that the topics covered in this book are indeed essential 
ingredients of the developing foundations of data science.”
—Santosh Vempala,Georgia Institute of Technology 

“Renowned for his deep contributions to high-dimensional probability,Roman Vershynin is 
to be commended for the clarity of his progressive exposition of the important concepts,
tools,and techniques of the field.Advanced students and practitioners interested in the 
mathematical foundations of data science will enjoy the many relevant worked examples 
and lively use of exercises.This book is the reference I had been waiting for.”
—Rémi Gribonval,IEEE &EURASIP Fellow,Directeur de Recherche,Inria,France 
“High-dimensional probability is a fascinating mathematical theory that has grown rapidly 
in recent years.It is fundamental to high-dimensional statistics,machine learning,and data 
science.In this book,Roman Vershynin,who is a leading researcher in high-dimensional 
probability and a master of exposition,provides the basic tools and some of the main results 
and applications of high-dimensional probability.This book is an excellent textbook for 
a graduate course that will be appreciated by mathematics,statistics,computer science,
and engineering students.It will also serve as an excellent reference book for researchers 
working in high-dimensional probability and statistics.”
—Elchanan Mossel,Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
“This book on the theory and application of high-dimensional probability is a work of 
exceptional clarity that will be valuable to students and researchers interested in the founda-
tions of data science.A working knowledge of high-dimensional probability is essential for 
researchers at the intersection of applied mathematics,statistics,and computer science.The 
widely accessible presentation will make this book a classic that everyone in foundational 
data science will want to have on their bookshelf.”
—Alfred Hero,University of Michigan 
“Vershynin’s book is a brilliant introduction to the mathematics which is at the core of 
modern signal processing and data science.The focus is on concentration of measure and its 
applications to random matrices,random graphs,dimensionality reduction,and suprema of 
random process.The treatment is remarkably clean,and the reader will learn beautiful and 
deep mathematics without unnecessary formalism.”
—Andrea Montanari,Stanford University 

High-Dimensional Probability 
An Introduction with Applications in Data Science 
High-Dimensional Probability offers insight into the behavior of random vectors,
random matrices,random subspaces,and objects used to quantify uncertainty in 
high dimensions.Drawing on ideas from probability,analysis,and geometry,it lends 
itself to applications in mathematics,statistics,theoretical computer science,signal 
processing,optimization,and more.It is the first text to integrate theory,key tools,
and modern applications of high-dimensional probability.Concentration inequalities 
form the core,and it covers both classical results such as Hoeffding’s and Cher-
noff’s inequalities and modern developments such as the matrix Bernstein inequality.
It then introduces powerful methods based on stochastic processes,including such 
tools as Slepian’s,Sudakov’s,and Dudley’s inequalities,as well as generic chain-
ing and bounds based on VC dimension.A broad range of illustrations is embedded 
throughout,including classical and modern results for covariance estimation,clus-
tering,networks,semidefinite programming,coding,dimension reduction,matrix 
completion,machine learning,compressed sensing,and sparse regression.Hints for 
many of the exercises are given at the back of the book.
ROMAN VERSHYNIN is Professor of Mathematics at the University of Califor-
nia,Irvine.He studies random geometric structures across mathematics and data 
sciences,in particular in random matrix theory,geometric functional analysis,con-
vex and discrete geometry,geometric combinatorics,high-dimensional statistics,
information theory,machine learning,signal processing,and numerical analysis.
His honors include an Alfred Sloan Research Fellowship in 2005,an invited talk 
at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Hyderabad in 2010,and a Bessel 
Research Award from the Humboldt Foundation in 2013.His “Introduction to the 
non-asymptotic analysis of random matrices”has become a popular educational 
resource for many new researchers in probability and data science.
