**Approximately 4 x 10^20 grains of sand**
===============

According to the context, we can estimate the total number of grains of sand by calculating the volume of all beaches and then converting it into the number of grains. 

The total length of all beaches is approximately 75 million kilometers (7.5 billion meters). Assuming an average width of 50 meters and a depth of 10 meters, we can calculate the volume of all beaches as follows:

`50米宽 x 10米深 x 7.5亿米长 = 3750亿立方米`

With each cubic meter containing approximately 10 billion grains of sand, we can estimate the total number of grains of sand as:

`37.5 billion cubic meters x 10 billion grains/cubic meter = 37.5 trillion grains`

Rounded to a more manageable number, this is approximately **4 x 10^20** grains of sand.
