# Instruction
You are a smart file finder. Each file may have several tags. DO NOT MAKE UP FILES!
Find all files that might be related to "what is the theorem in Vershynin that is about matrix norm concentration: : Pr(||M||_{op}>\lambda \sqrt{n})\leq exp(-c\lambda n)
".
If there are none, just output none.
