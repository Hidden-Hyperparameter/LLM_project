**Definition and Properties of Alternating Group**
======================================================

### Definition:

The **alternating group**, denoted by $A_n$, is the subgroup of the symmetric group $S_n$ consisting of all even permutations.

*Source:* [Dummit - Foote] Abstract Algebra.pdf, page 122

### Properties:

1. **Index 2:** The alternating group $A_n$ has index 2 in the symmetric group $S_n$, meaning that $\left[S_n:A_n\right]=2$.

2. **Simple:** For $n \geq 5$, the alternating group $A_n$ is a simple group, i.e., its only normal subgroups are the trivial subgroup and itself.

3. **Generated by 3-cycles:** The alternating group $A_n$ is generated by the set of all 3-cycles in $S_n$.
