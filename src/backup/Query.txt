Lecture 5:Energy and Work 
In this Chapter,we introduce the concept of energy and work and their applications in various 
physical processes.Energy is one of the most basic concepts in physics and appears in many 
different forms,such as potential energy and heat.Historically,people do not even know all these 
forms belong to the same term,energy.Moreover,work plays the role of converting one form of 
energy to another.In addition,we also show the conservation law of energy,which is one of the 
most universal laws in nature.

I.ENERGY AND WORK 
In physics,energy is a property of objects which can be transferred to other objects or converted into different forms.
The ‘ability of a system to perform work’is a common description,but it is difficult to give one single comprehensive 
definition of energy because of its various forms.For instance,in SI units,energy is measured in joules,and one joule 
is defined ‘mechanically’,being the energy transferred to an object by the mechanical work of moving it a distance of 
1meter against a force of 1newton.However,there are many other definitions of energy,depending on the context,
such as thermal energy,radiant energy,electromagnetic energy,nuclear energy,etc.,where definitions are derived for 
the sake of convenience.
A.Work done by constant and non-constant forces 
The physical concept of work can be mathematically described by the scalar product between the force and the 
displacement vectors (see Fig.1),
AW =F.Ar =FAr cos.(1)
In the limit when Ar’—->0,then the displacement becomes dr and 
dW =F -dr,(2)
where dr’has the same direction of v.Note that we use dW instead of dW due to the fact that W is not a state 
function.Instead,W depends on the path of the movement.

FIG.1.Force and displacement are not in the same direction.
Question 1.Is there any relation between F .dF and Fdr,like Eq.(1)?What about F\d?|?
For simplicity,we illustrate the work done by a constant /non-constant force in one dimension.Suppose a body moves 
from an initial point x;to a final point xf so that the displacement of the point the force acts on is Ax =xf —a;>0.
The work done by a constant force F%=Fey acting on the body is the product of the component of the force 
F®and the displacement Az,
W*=FtAg.(3)
Work is a scalar quantity;it is not a vector quantity.The SI unit for work is [IN +m]=[lkg-m-s7?][1m]=
[lkg-m?-s~?]=[1J].The SI unit of energy is named for James Prescott Joule.
The displacement that appears in the above equation is not the displacement of the body but the displacement of 
the point of application of the force.For point-like objects,the displacement of the point of application of the force 
is equal to the displacement of the body.However,for an extended body,we need to focus on where the force acts 
and whether or not that point of application undergoes any displacement in the direction of the force.
Consider a body moving in the x-direction under the influence of a non-constant force in the x-direction,F =F,(x)t.
The body moves from an initial position x;to a final position xs.The work done by this non-constant force is 
given by 
rf 
作二/F,,(x)da.(4)
Generally,the work done by a non-constant force along an arbitrary path is 
一一W二/Bar.(5)
Here,we give three examples:Example |is the scenario where the directions of the force and the displacement 
possess angles,Example 2is about the work done by non-constant force,and Example 3considers the case when a 
pair of forces are applied on two particles.
Example 1(Work done by force applied at an angle to the direction of displacement).Suppose we push the cup by 
a constant force with the magnitude F®and at an angle @upwards with respect to the table,for a distance of Ax.
Friction should not be ignored.Calculate the work done by the pushing force.Calculate the work done by the kinetic 
frictional force.
FIG.2.Force diagram on the object.
Solution.The force diagram on the cup and coordinate system is shown in Figure 2.
The x-component of the pushing force is 
FY =F“cos@.(6)
Suppose a body moves from an initial point xo to a final point xf so that the displacement of the point the force 
acts on is positive Ax =xf —x)>0.The work done by a constant force Fo =Py acting on the body is the 
product of the component of the force Ff and the displacement Az,
W°=FY Ar =F%cos dAz.(7)
The kinetic frictional force is 
FP =—y,Ni =F%.(8)
In this case,the magnitude of the normal force is not simply the same as the weight of the cup.To find the normal 
force,we need to find the y-component of the applied force and apply Newtons Second Law in the y-direction,
FY =F“sin@PN ma (9)

Then the work done by the kinetic frictional force is

Example 2(Work done by the spring force).Fix one end of a spring to a wall and connect the other end of the 
spring to a body resting on a smooth (frictionless)table,as shown in Figure 3.Stretch the spring and release the 
spring-body system.How much work does the spring do on the body as a function of the stretched or compressed length 
of the spring?
Solution.We first begin by choosing a coordinate system with origin at the position of the body when the spring is 
at rest in the equilibrium position.We choose the 7unit vector to point in the direction that the body moves when 
the spring is being stretched and the coordinate x to denote the position of the body with respect to the equilibrium 
position,as in Fig.3(which indicates that in general the position x will be a function of time).The spring force on 
the body is given by 
F*=F%,=—kai (11)

FIG.4.The x-component of the spring force as a function of «.
In Fig.4we show the graph of the z-component of the spring force as a function of x for both positive values of x 
corresponding to stretching,and negative values of x corresponding to compressing of the spring.Note that xo and 
xz can be positive,zero,or negative.
The work done is just the area under the curve for the interval xo to xf,

LO LO 
When the absolute value of the final distance is less than the absolute value of the initial distance,|x|<|xo|,the 
work done by the spring force is positive.This means that if the spring is less stretched or compressed in the final 
state than in the initial state,the work done by the spring force is positive.The spring force does positive work on 
the body when the spring goes from a state of greater tension to a state of lesser tension.口
Example 3(Work done by a pair of forces).Consider a pair of forces F,and Fy acting on two particles A,and 
Ay.Suppose F,+F,=0.Calculate the work caused by F,and Fy,and show that it only depends on the variance of 
relative distance T19.

FIG.5.Work done by a pair of force.
Solution.The work W is 
W=Wi4+W2=F.-(%-—71)+F-(%—7)
=—Fo-(7-71)+Fo -(7-7)(13)
=Fy:((%-7)—(2-74)=Fa (Fe —72),
from where we can see that W only depends on the change of rj2.口
B.Power applied by a force 
Suppose that an applied force F®acts ona body during a time interval At,and the displacement of the point of 
application of the force is in the x-direction by an amount Az.
The average power of an applied force is defined to be the rate at which work is done,
a _AW®ˇF2Az 
ave"At At 一万`睾乙微鲫U巳$'(14)
The instantaneous power at time t is defined to be the limit of the average power as the time interval [t,t +At]
approaches zero,
Az ,AW?FReAaz 。a _pa 
ee ato BE aly Ar alo Re Pet 峡
The average power delivered to the body is equal to the component of the force in the direction of motion times the 
component of the average velocity of the body.The instantaneous power of a constant applied force is the product 
of the component of the force in the direction of motion and the instantaneous velocity of the moving object.Power 
is a scalar quantity and can be positive,zero,or negative depending on the sign of work.The SI units of power are 
called watts [W]and [1W]=[1/7-s71].
Generally,the instantaneous power of a non-constant force at time t is 
P(t)=F(t)-&(t).(16)
C.Kinetic energy and work-kinetic energy theorem 
The kinetic energy K of a point particle of mass m moving with speed v is defined to be the non-negative scalar 
quantity 
二一二一`叶'1Kk 50245nd 7(17)
The kinetic energy is proportional to the square of the speed.The SI units for kinetic energy are [kg -m?-s~?].This 
combination of units is defined to be a joule and is denoted by [J],thus 1J =1kg-m?-s~?.The above definition of 
kinetic energy does not refer to any direction of motion,just the speed of the body.
There is a direct connection between the work done on a point particle and the change in kinetic energy the point 
particle undergoes.If the work done on the particle is non-zero,this implies that an unbalanced force has acted on 
the particle,and the particle will have undergone acceleration.For a particle undergoing one-dimensional motion,the 
work done on the particle by the component of the sum of the forces in the direction of displacement is given by 
“fF 11W=/F,,(a)dx =sy 一svi =Ky —Kj.(18)
This formula can be easily obtained from the second law of Newton for a point particle in one-dimensional motion.
In a general case,we consider the change of kinetic energy over a tiny time interval dt.The changing rate of kinetic 
energy is given by 
aK 1,a@-a)

Here dW is the work applied to the system over the time interval dt.The second equality can be derived from the 
Cartesian coordinates

dt dt dt dt dt dt |
Integrate Eq.(19)over time,we obtain similar results as the one in Eq.(18).
When the work done on an object is positive,the object increases its speed,and negative work done on an object 
causes a decrease in speed.When the work done is zero,the object will maintain a constant speed.In fact,the 
work-energy relationship is quite precise;the work done by the applied force on an object is identically equal to the 
change in kinetic energy of the object.
Example 4(Gravity and the work-energy theorem).Suppose a ball of mass m =0.2kg starts from rest at a height 
Yo =15m above the surface of the Earth and falls down to a height yr =5.0m above the surface of the Earth.What 
is the change in the kinetic energy?Find the final velocity using the work-energy theorem.
Solution.As only one force acts on the ball,the change in kinetic energy is the work done by gravity,
W*=—mg(yz —Yo)=20/.(21)
The ball started from rest,vy,o =0.So the change in kinetic energy is 
111AK =vs 一ae =By,Ff (22)
We can solve Eq.(22)for the final velocity using Eq.(
2AK _
Vy,f =
For the falling ball in a constant gravitation feld.th the nositive work of the gravitation force on the body corresponds 
to an increasing kinetic energy and speed.For a rising body in the same field,the kinetic energy and hence the speed 
decrease since the work done is negative.厂二140n1.5(23)
D.Kinetic energy of a system 
For system of particles,the kinetic energy of the system is the summation of the kinetic energy of the particles:
K=dK =5x mild.(24)
Given a system of particles,the relationship between the total kinetic energy in two different reference frames is 
generally rather messy and unenlightening.But we know the COM frame is a very nice reference frame in the chapter 
of momentum,as the total momentum turns out to be 0in the COM frame.Here we will find that if one of the 
reference frames is the COM frame,the relationship between the total kinetic energy will be quite neat.
Let S’be the COM frame,which moves at velocity @with respect to another reference frame S.Then the velocities 
of the particles in the two reference frames are related by 
政二伟十伟(25)
The kinetic energy in the COM frame is

The kinetic energy in frame S is

where M is the total mass of the system,and where we have used 5),m,v;=0,by definition of the COM frame.
Therefore,the kinetic energy in any frame equals the kinetic energy in the COM frame,plus the kinetic energy of 
the whole system treated like a point mass M located at the COM (which moves with velocity uv).An immediate 
corollary of this fact is that the kinetic energy in the COM frame is the smallest one among that in all the reference 
frames.
Il.POTENTIAL ENERGY 
A.Conservative forces and changes in potential energies of a system 
Whenever the work done by a force in moving an object from an initial point to a final point is independent of the 
path,the force is called a conservative force.In other words,the work done by a conservative force F'(7)in going 
around a closed path L is zero:
§FG)-ar=o.(28)
工
Examples of conservative force are constant gravity near the surface of the Earth,the spring force and the universal 
gravitation force.
Consider a system consisting of two objects interacting through a conservative force.Denote Foy to be the force 
on object 1due to the interaction with object 2and 
dra 1=dr}一dro.(29)
to be the relative displacement of the two objects.The change in internal potential energy of the system is 
defined to be the negative of the work done by the conservative force when the objects undergo a relative displacement 
from the initial state A to the final state B along any displacement that changes the initial state A to the final state 
B,
B 
May.=-We=~|尼1d 口l (30)
A 
Our definition of potential energy only holds for conservative forces,because the work done by a conservative force 
does not depend on the path but only on the initial and final positions.
Depending on the specific scenario,we shall choose a zero reference potential for the potential energy of the 
system,so that we can consider all changes in potential energy relative to this reference potential.
Consider the example of an object falling near the surface of the Earth.Choose the system consisting of the Earth 
and the object.The gravitational force is now an internal conservative force acting inside the system.The distance 
separating the object and the center of mass of the Earth,and the velocities of the Earth and the object specify the 
initial and final states.
Let us choose a coordinate system with the origin on the surface of the Earth and the +y-direction pointing 
away from the center of the Earth.Because the displacement of the Earth is negligible,we need only consider the 
displacement of the object in order to calculate the change in potential energy of the system.
Suppose the object starts at an initial height y;above the surface of the Earth and ends at final height yz.The 
gravitational force on the object is usually approximated by F9=—mqj,the displacement is given by dr =dyj,and 
the scalar product is given by 
F9.dF =—mgqj -dyj =—mgdy.(31)
The work done by the gravitational force on the object is then

The change in potential energy is then given by 
AU!=—W4=mgyz —mgyi-(33)
We introduce a potential energy function U so that 
AUY =UF 一U (34)
Only differences in the function U%have a physical meaning.We can choose a zero reference point for the potential 
energy anywhere we like.We have some flexibility to adapt our choice of zero for the potential energy to best fit a 
particular problem.Because the change in potential energy only depends on the vertical displacement,Ay =ys —yi.
In the above expression for the change of potential energy,let yg =y be an arbitrary point and y;=0denote the 
surface of the Earth.Choose the zero reference potential for the potential energy to be at the surface of the Earth 
corresponding to our origin y =0,with U2(0)=0.Then 
AU*=U%(y)—U9(0)=U4(y).(35)
Substitute y;=0,yr =y to above equations yielding a potential energy as a function of the height y above the 
surface of the Earth,
U%(y)=mgy,(36)
with U9(y =0)=0.
Notice that until here,we are talking about the potential energy of a system or a pair of objects.Due to Newton’s 
Third Law,we need to consider the work done by a pair of forces.But what if one of the objects,object 2,is always 
stable or can be regarded as stable?Just like the former system consisting of the Earth and the object,we can regard 
the Earth as a stable object.Then in Eq.(29)the relative displacement is dr and 
B 
AU =-|Fy -ari,(37)
A 
which can be regarded as the potential energy of object 1,AU;.
In one-dimensional case,with the relationship between integral and derivation we can get the conservation force 
from potential energy,

And in general,it should be written as a gradient,
Fy,=—VU.(39)

b)The force on the particle is zero at the minimum of the potential which occurs at

c)Consider a fixed value of the energy of the particle within the range

are solutions to the equation

then the particle will undergo periodic motion between the values Xa 一习人X5b.、Within this region Xa 一乙一Xb,the 
kinetic energy is always nonnegative because K(x)=E —U(a).There is another solution x,to Eq.(47)somewhere 
in the region Ze。>22,/3.If the particle at any time is in the region x >x,then it at any later time it is restricted 
to the region r.<©<+00.口
B.Potential energy raised by gravitational force 
Now we consider the potential energy originated by a common conservative force:gravitational force.For two 
particles A and B with mass m,and mp,the gravitational force of A acting on B is given by 
=TAB Fap =—Gmampz—,(48)
"AB 
where G is the gravitational constant,74g is the displacement vector from A to B.
Now we fix the location of A,and move B from the position B;to By,as shown in Fig.7.We would like to calculate 
the work of Fap acting on B.

From Eq.(49)we can see that,the gravitational force is conservative.If we set the gravitational potential U,(r 一

1U,(r)=—Gmamp—(50)
Example 6(Escape velocity of Toro,from MIT OpenCourseWare 8.01).The asteroid Toro,discovered in 1964,has 
a radius of about R =5.0km and a mass of about mz =2.0x 10!°kg.Let’s assume that Toro is a perfectly uniform 
sphere.What is the escape velocity for an object of mass m on the surface of Toro?Could a person reach this speed 
(on the Earth)by running?
Solution.The only potential energy in this problem is the gravitational potential energy.We choose the zero point 
for the potential energy to be when the object and Toro are an infinite distance apart,U@(oo)=0.With this choice,
the potential energy when the object and Toro are a finite distance r apart is given by 
U(r)=on (51)万
with UC(co)=0.The expression escape velocity refers to the minimum speed necessary for an object to escape the 
gravitational interaction of the asteroid and move off to an infinite distance away.If the object has a speed less than 
the escape velocity,it will be unable to escape the gravitational force and must return to Toro.If the object has a 
speed greater than the escape velocity,it will have a non-zero kinetic energy at infinity.The condition for the escape 
velocity is that the object will have exactly zero kinetic energy at infinity.
We choose our initial state,at time ¢;,when the object is at the surface of the asteroid with speed equal to the 
escape velocity Uesc.We choose our final state,at time t¢,to occur when the separation distance between the asteroid 
and the object is finite.
The initial kinetic energy is Kk;=Le The initial potential energy is U;=—Sri and so the initial mechanical 
energy is 
1G 
i 二Ki 十L =菖门飞微萱SC 一门摹亡们z (52)
The final kinetic energy is Kz =0,because this is the condition that defines the escape velocity.The final potential 
energy is zero,Us =0because we chose the zero point for potential energy at infinity.The final mechanical energy 
is then 
Ey =Ky+U;7=0.(53)
