domain we are considering is understood we shall occasionally denote f|,4again simply 
as f even though these are formally different functions (their domains are different).
If AC Band g:A —C and there is a function f :B >C such that f|,=g,
we Shall say f is an extension of g to B (such a map f need not exist nor be unique).
Let A be a nonempty set.
(1)A binary relation on aset A is asubset R of A x Aand wewritea ~bif(a,b)€R.
(2)The relation ~on A is said to be:

to B and the value of f ata is denoted f(a)(i.e.,we shall apply all our functions on 
the left).We use the words function and map interchangeably.The set A is called the 
domain of f and B is called the codomain of f.The notation f :ath bora br bif f 
is understood indicates that f(a)=b,i.e.,the function is being specified on elements.
If the function f is not specified on elements it is important in general to check
