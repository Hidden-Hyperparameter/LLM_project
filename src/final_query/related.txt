.Write out the cycle decomposition of each element of order 2in S4.
.Prove that if Q ={1,2,3,...}then Sp is an infinite group (do not say co!=oo).
-(a)Leto be the 12-cycle (123456789101112).For which positive integers i is 
oa!also a 12-cycle?|
(b)Let t be the 8-cycle (12345678).For which positive integers i is t'also an 
8-cycle?
(c)Let w be the 14-cycle (1234567891011121314).For which positive integers 
iis w'also a 14-cycle?

We shall see in Section 6that the structure of Sp depends only on the cardinality of Q ,not on the 
particular elements of Q itself,so if Q is any finite set with n elements,then Sp “looks like”S,,.

The product of all the cycles is called the cycle decomposition of o.
We now give an algorithm for computing the cycle decomposition of an element o

3then 3is mapped to 1,completing this cycle in the product:(134).Finally,2is sent 
to 1,then 1is sent to 2so 2is fixed by this product and so (123)0(12)(34=(134)
is the cycle decomposition of the product.
As additional examples,
(12)o (13)=(132)and d 3)0(12)=(123).
In particular this shows that 
S,ts a non-abelian group for all n >3.
Each cycle (a;a2...d,,)inacycle decomposition can be viewed as the permutation 
which cyclically permutes aj,a2,...,GQ,and fixes all other integers.Since disjoint

(a)Let p 二PCrl,…,x4)be the polynomial in (x)above,let o =(1234)and let 
t =(123).Computeo -p,t-(o-p),(toa)-p,and (aot):p.
(b)Prove that these definitions give a (left)group action of S4on R.
(c)Exhibit all permutations in $4that stabilize x4and prove that they form a subgroup 
isomorphic to $3.
