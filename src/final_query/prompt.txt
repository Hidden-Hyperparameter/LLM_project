Proof This result follows by combining Theorem 7.3.1with the concentration inequality 
in Gaussian space,Theorem 5.2.2.
To use concentration,let us view A as a long random vector in R”*”by concatenating 
the rows.This makes A a standard normal random vector,i.e.A ~N(O,Inm).Consider the 
function f(A):=||A||that assigns to the vector A the operator norm of the matrix A.We 
have 
F(A)=IlAll2,

Tropp’s proof of Theorem 5.4.1.The book [201]presents a self-contained proof of Lieb’s 
inequality (Theorem 5.4.8),the matrix Hoeffding inequality from Exercise 5.4.12,the matrix 
Chernoff inequality,and much more.Owing to Tropp’s contributions,there now exist matrix 
analogs of almost all the classical scalar concentration results [201].The survey [161]dis-

independent sub-gaussian rows.We used the ¢-net argument to control the norm of A as 
follows:
E||All <v 十CV7,
where C is a constant.(See Exercise 4.6.3.)We now use the Sudakov—Fernique inequality to 
improve upon this bound for Gaussian random matrices,showing that it holds with a sharp 
constant C =1.
